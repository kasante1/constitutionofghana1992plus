<p>TEHN-ADDY VRS ELECTORAL COMMISSION [1997-98] 1 GLR 47</p>
<p>The Plaintiff sought for a declaration that the failure or refusal of the Electoral Commission to register him as a voter is inconsistent with and in contravention of articles 42, 45 and 46 of the constitution, 1992.</p>
<p>The court held that under the Constitution, 1992 failure to register as a voter did not only forbid one from voting at national and district level but also, inter alia, disqualified one under article 94(1) (a) from being a member of Parliament and from holding several specified public positions under articles 44(1), 62(c), 78(1) and 232(2) of the Constitution, 1992. The disabilities attached to non-registration were therefore quite onerous.</p>
<p>Therefore every sane Ghanaian citizen of eighteen years and above has the right under article 42 of the constitution to be registered as a voter. The exercise of that constitutional right is indispensable in the enhancement of the democratic process. This right, cannot be denied in the absence of a constitutional provision to that effect.</p>
<p>See</p>
<p>Articles 44(1), 45, 46, 62(c), 78(1) and 232(2)</p>
<h2 id="article-42_1">Article 42</h2>
<p>AHUMAH OCANSEY v. THE ELECTORAL COMMISSION AND CENTRE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS &amp; CIVIL LIBERTIES v. THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL &amp; ANOTHER </p>
<p>CONSOLIDATED SUITS:  WRIT NO. JI/4/2008, WRIT NO. JI/5/2008 23RD MARCH, 2010</p>
<p>The Plaintiff sought for a declaration from the Supreme Court that non-registration of prisoners for voting by the electoral commission contravenes article 42 and 45(a) of the constitution.</p>
<p>Again the Plaintiff sought for a declaration from the Supreme Court that refusal or failure of the electoral commission to register prisoners for voting is a violation of their rights as citizens of Ghana if the only basis of their exclusion from the electoral process is the fact of their being prisoners.</p>
<p>The court held that the fact of being confined to prison under a sentence of remand by a court of competent jurisdiction or under conviction for an offence that is known under the laws of Ghana and also under a sentence by a Court of competent jurisdiction does not make the person i.e. the prisoner any less a citizen of the Republic of Ghana as defined under articles 6, 7 and 8 of the Constitution of Ghana, 1992, the rights of all citizens including prisoners are protected.</p>
<p>In that respect, therefore, any citizen of Ghana, who before his conviction or remand is a citizen of Ghana continues with the right of citizenship irrespective of his change of status. This means that the Constitution and laws of Ghana, do not change the rights of citizenship of Ghanaians acquired before their incarceration, conviction, sentence and remand.</p>
<p>Therefore, prisoners have the right to be registered to enable them to vote as citizens of Ghana. </p>
<p>See</p>
<p>Articles 15(1), 17(1) and (2), 35(4)</p>
<h2 id="article-46">Article 46</h2>
<p>AMEGATCHER  V  THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL AND THE ELECTORAL COMMISSION [2012] GHASC 40</p>
<p>The plaintiff sought for an order restraining the Electoral Commission from acting in any way whatsoever pursuant to directions made by the President in furtherance of section 1 (3) of the Local Government Act 1993 (Act 462). </p>
<p>Per Date-Bah JSC
Thus though   Article 46 prohibits the subjection of the Electoral Commission to the direction or control of any other person or authority, it seems to contemplate, by way of exception, the possibility of a law other than the Constitution providing for the direction of the Electoral Commission, provided that that law is not inconsistent with the Constitution. The issue that arises then is whether the direction provided for in section 1(3) of the Local Government Act, 1993 is inconsistent with the Constitution. It could be argued that the independence of the Electoral Commission that is protected relates to electoral matters. On those matters, it is unconstitutional for any direction or control to be exerted over the Commission. However, on non-electoral matters, there could be scope for the direction provided for by statute, so long as such direction does not reduce or imperil the efficacy of the Electoral Commission in the discharge of its electoral responsibilities. It is in this context that one should assess the constitutionality of section 1(3) of the Local Government Act, 1993, which, it will be recalled, states that:
“(3) The President shall in the exercise of his powers under sub-section (2) (a) direct the Electoral Commission to make appropriate recommendations”. In my view, this direction is unlikely to impair the performance of the Electoral Commission’s electoral responsibilities, whilst, on the other hand, it may improve the quality of the President’s decision-making in the declaration of new areas as districts. On balance, therefore, I am inclined to decide that the President’s power of direction under section 1(3) of the Local Government Act, 1993 is not unconstitutional. 
“The Electoral Commission shall at the request of the President review areas of authority of unit committees, town, area, zonal, urban and sub-metropolitan district councils and district, municipal and metropolitan assemblies and make such recommendations as it considers appropriate to the President.”</p>
