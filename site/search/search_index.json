Interpretation/Insight Article 42 TEHN-ADDY VRS ELECTORAL COMMISSION [1997-98] 1 GLR 47 The Plaintiff sought for a declaration that the failure or refusal of the Electoral Commission to register him as a voter is inconsistent with and in contravention of articles 42, 45 and 46 of the constitution, 1992. The court held that under the Constitution, 1992 failure to register as a voter did not only forbid one from voting at national and district level but also, inter alia, disqualified one under article 94(1) (a) from being a member of Parliament and from holding several specified public positions under articles 44(1), 62(c), 78(1) and 232(2) of the Constitution, 1992. The disabilities attached to non-registration were therefore quite onerous. Therefore every sane Ghanaian citizen of eighteen years and above has the right under article 42 of the constitution to be registered as a voter. The exercise of that constitutional right is indispensable in the enhancement of the democratic process. This right, cannot be denied in the absence of a constitutional provision to that effect. See Articles 44(1), 45, 46, 62(c), 78(1) and 232(2) Article 42 AHUMAH OCANSEY v. THE ELECTORAL COMMISSION AND CENTRE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS & CIVIL LIBERTIES v. THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL & ANOTHER CONSOLIDATED SUITS: WRIT NO. JI/4/2008, WRIT NO. JI/5/2008 23RD MARCH, 2010 The Plaintiff sought for a declaration from the Supreme Court that non-registration of prisoners for voting by the electoral commission contravenes article 42 and 45(a) of the constitution. Again the Plaintiff sought for a declaration from the Supreme Court that refusal or failure of the electoral commission to register prisoners for voting is a violation of their rights as citizens of Ghana if the only basis of their exclusion from the electoral process is the fact of their being prisoners. The court held that the fact of being confined to prison under a sentence of remand by a court of competent jurisdiction or under conviction for an offence that is known under the laws of Ghana and also under a sentence by a Court of competent jurisdiction does not make the person i.e. the prisoner any less a citizen of the Republic of Ghana as defined under articles 6, 7 and 8 of the Constitution of Ghana, 1992, the rights of all citizens including prisoners are protected. In that respect, therefore, any citizen of Ghana, who before his conviction or remand is a citizen of Ghana continues with the right of citizenship irrespective of his change of status. This means that the Constitution and laws of Ghana, do not change the rights of citizenship of Ghanaians acquired before their incarceration, conviction, sentence and remand. Therefore, prisoners have the right to be registered to enable them to vote as citizens of Ghana. See Articles 15(1), 17(1) and (2), 35(4) Article 46 AMEGATCHER V THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL AND THE ELECTORAL COMMISSION [2012] GHASC 40 The plaintiff sought for an order restraining the Electoral Commission from acting in any way whatsoever pursuant to directions made by the President in furtherance of section 1 (3) of the Local Government Act 1993 (Act 462). Per Date-Bah JSC Thus though Article 46 prohibits the subjection of the Electoral Commission to the direction or control of any other person or authority, it seems to contemplate, by way of exception, the possibility of a law other than the Constitution providing for the direction of the Electoral Commission, provided that that law is not inconsistent with the Constitution. The issue that arises then is whether the direction provided for in section 1(3) of the Local Government Act, 1993 is inconsistent with the Constitution. It could be argued that the independence of the Electoral Commission that is protected relates to electoral matters. On those matters, it is unconstitutional for any direction or control to be exerted over the Commission. However, on non-electoral matters, there could be scope for the direction provided for by statute, so long as such direction does not reduce or imperil the efficacy of the Electoral Commission in the discharge of its electoral responsibilities. It is in this context that one should assess the constitutionality of section 1(3) of the Local Government Act, 1993, which, it will be recalled, states that: \u201c(3) The President shall in the exercise of his powers under sub-section (2) (a) direct the Electoral Commission to make appropriate recommendations\u201d. In my view, this direction is unlikely to impair the performance of the Electoral Commission\u2019s electoral responsibilities, whilst, on the other hand, it may improve the quality of the President\u2019s decision-making in the declaration of new areas as districts. On balance, therefore, I am inclined to decide that the President\u2019s power of direction under section 1(3) of the Local Government Act, 1993 is not unconstitutional. \u201cThe Electoral Commission shall at the request of the President review areas of authority of unit committees, town, area, zonal, urban and sub-metropolitan district councils and district, municipal and metropolitan assemblies and make such recommendations as it considers appropriate to the President.\u201d","title":"Chapter  Seven"},{"location":"Chapter%20%20Seven/#article-42-right-to-vote","text":"Every citizen of Ghana of eighteen years of age or above and of sound mind has the right to vote and is entitled to be registered as a voter for the purposes of public elections and referenda.","title":"Article 42 RIGHT TO VOTE"},{"location":"Chapter%20%20Seven/#article-43-electoral-commission","text":"(1) There shall be an Electoral Commission which shall consist of - (a) A Chairman; (b) Two Deputy Chairmen; and (c) Four other members.

Interpretation/Insight Article 70(1) (d) (iii) THEOPHILUS DONKOR V THE ATTORNEY GENERAL [2019] GHASC 52 Upon a true and proper interpretation, a Public Service Officer appointed in accordance with Article 195 of the Constitution and may not be removed save in accordance with the terms and conditions of his or her contract of engagement or in the absence of such, for \"just cause\u201f pursuant to Articles 191 and 195 of the Constitution. Members of governing boards of statutory boards and corporations appointed in accordance with Article 70(1) (d) (iii) of the Constitution are not members of the Public Service and their tenure is not governed by Articles 191 and 195 of the Constitution. Therefore, each person may be removed at will by the President. To the extent that Section 14 of the Presidential (Transition) Act 2012, (Act 845) requires Chief Executives or Directors-General (howsoever described) of public boards or corporations to cease to hold office upon the assumption of office by a person elected as President of the Republic of Ghana, the same is hereby declared to be unconstitutional and void for being in contravention of Articles 190 and 191 of the Constitution. See Article 190,191, 195. Article 72 AGBEMAVA, TUAH-YEBOAH, BEDIATUO VRS ATTORNEY GENERAL (J1/20/2016 J1/21/2016 J1/23/2016) [2018] GHASC 52 (21 November 2018) Whether or not the words \u201cconvicted of an offence\u201d in article 72 of the Constitution 1992 includes committal and conviction for the offence of contempt of court by the Superior Court under article 126(2) of the Constitution. The court held that the Constitution 1992 makes no reservation to exclude convictions for contempt of court from the application of Article 72. Criminal contempt is an offence and attracts criminal penalties as a misdemeanour, whether it is charged under Article 126(2) of the Constitution or section 224 of Act 29; the consequences are the same. The court relied on the case of Republic v. Numapau; Ex Parte Ameyaw and Others (1999-2000) GLR 283 where the court stated that contempt of court has all the characteristics of a crime, hence there is the need for a prima facie case to be made out before all available defences may be considered. Consequently, it is an offence within the meaning of article 72 of the 1992 Constitution. Therefore, the prerogative of mercy extends to persons convicted of criminal contempt Besides all that has been said, the standard of proof required in a charge of scandalising the court, scurrilous publication about a judge and all matters that bring the administration of justice into public ridicule and hatred or interfere with the administration of justice is proof beyond a reasonable doubt, the same standard as in all criminal offences. See: ACKAH V. ACHEAMPONG & ANOTHER [2005-2006] SCGLR 1 REPUBLIC V. NUMAPAU; EX PARTE AMEYAW AND OTHERS (1999-2000) GLR 283; (1998-99) SCGLR 639; REPUBLIC V. ALHASSAN; EX PARTE ABBEY (1989-90) 1 GLR 139; GBADAMOSI V. MOHAMMADU (1991) 1 GLR 283. Whether or not the prerogative of mercy of the President of the Republic under article 72 of the Constitution, 1992, extends to and covers a power to grant pardon to persons, who have been convicted for contempt of court, by the Superior Courts under article 126(2) of the Constitution, 1992. The court has already held that contempt is an offence within the meaning of article 72 of the 1992 Constitution. Therefore the prerogative of mercy extends to persons convicted of criminal contempt Whether or not, if the President\u2019s prerogative of mercy under article 72 of the Constitution, 1992, extends to, and covers, a power to grant pardon to persons so committed and convicted, such power or prerogative of mercy is discretionary in terms of article 296 of the Constitution, 1992 and ought to be exercised in accordance with article 296(a) & (b) thereof. Article 296(c) applies particularly to persons to whom the Constitution has ascribed some duties involving the use of discretion, without prescribing how those duties are to be performed or supervised. The practice has been that the advisory bodies to the President must have rules and regulations to guide their functions. The rationale for article 296 is to check the abuse of discretionary power. Thus in situations where the Constitution itself provides the safeguards like the instant case ( Article 72 \u201cthe president acts in consultation with the Council of State\u201d), it is our opinion that the use of the said power must be viewed in the light of the safeguards provided and where it is found that the safeguards were complied with, then that power would be deemed to have been properly utilised in terms of the said provision unless there is clear evidence that the advice to the President was tainted in some way, as stated above. The safeguard under Article 72 is the consultation with the Council of State which seems to have been satisfied in this case. And we do not have any evidence that the Council of State was in any way unlawfully influenced in its opinion to the President, which would undermine the exercise of the discretion Therefore, discretionary power in article 72 when used in accordance with its provisions, such exercise of the power of mercy will not be questioned by the Courts. Hence, so far as the exercise of the power under article 72 does not infringe any provisions in the Constitution, the Courts will not interfere. Whether or not the grant of remission of the sentence of the contemnors by the President constitutes an unjustified interference with the judiciary and an affront to the Constitution. The independence of the judiciary relates to its core mandate, that of administering justice, and with it its administrative support. Indeed the judicial power has been explained in article 125(4) to mean jurisdiction in all matters, civil and criminal, including matters relating to this Constitution, and such other jurisdiction as Parliament may, by law, confer on it. The judiciary is entirely free in taking judicial decisions and that is where its independence is guaranteed by the Constitution. But after the act or decision, the Constitution says these could be tampered with in appropriate cases, and it is the court's duty to respect the limitation on the power enjoyed by each organ, including the Judiciary. Thus it is in the course of performing this core mandate that the judiciary is completely insulated against any external interference. In criminal matters, the process of adjudication ends in a trial court after sentence is pronounced. After the imposition of a jail term on a person, the execution of the sentence is by executive action, and not judicial. Criminal Contempt of court is a public wrong, in as much as high treason or robbery is, so it is unreasonable to suggest that the people would allow the President to pardon for all criminal offences except criminal contempt of court, without using express words to that effect. In our view, if it was intended that conviction for contempt of court should be excluded, clear words to that effect would have been employed. It is thus a total misconception and misapplication of the doctrine of judicial independence to suggest that the judiciary is an island unto itself in the scheme of governance under the concept of separation of powers. Article 75 MARGARET BANFUL AND HENRY NANA BOAKYE VRS. THE ATTORNEY- GENERAL Writ No.J1/7/2016, Supreme Court, dated the 22nd June 2017 The Supreme Court was called upon to interpret whether documents exchanged between the Governments of Ghana and the United States of America described as \u2018Note Verbal\u2019 is in the category of agreements contemplated by Article 75 of the 1992 Constitution, which therefore ought to have been submitted to Parliament for ratification. Per Sophia Akuffo \u2018\u2019The Constitution makes no mention of any formal distinctions that are dependent on the formality with which such an instrument is formatted or brought into being.\u201d The Court held that a \u2018Note Verbal\u2019 exchanged between the Government of Ghana and the United States of America creates an obligation that binds the Republic of Ghana. Therefore, an international agreement has come into existence. Article 75(1), (2) YAW BROGYA GYAMFI VRS THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL WRIT NO. J1/13/2018 5TH MAY, 2020 The Plaintiff contends that the Agreement between the Government of the Republic of Ghana and the United States of America on Defence Co-operation which was submitted to Parliament for ratification under Article 75 of the Constitution was not signed by the State parties and for that matter it was not an executed agreement envisaged under Article 75 of the 1992 Constitution. Plaintiff argued that the Executive should have executed the Agreement before submitting same to Parliament for ratification and its failure rendered the ratification unconstitutional, null and void having breached Article 75 of the Constitution. The Court relied on the very useful guide that had been laid by this [Supreme] Court and Section 10 of the Interpretation Act, 2009 Act 792, the court is of the view that the intention of the framers of the 1992 Constitution will be achieved if the court adopted a very flexible and purposeful approach in interpreting Article 75 of the 1992 Constitution. The Supreme Court held that in substance the document which was submitted by the Executive to Parliament though \"unsigned\" was an agreement that created legal obligations between the Republic of Ghana and the United States of America because the constitution did not stipulate any special format for such agreements apart from the use of the term \u2018executed\u2019, which only refers to signatures. The court held that the Agreement did not contravene Article 75 of the 1992 Constitution neither did the submission of the unsigned international agreement to Parliament for ratification by the Executive contravened Article 75 and any provision of the 1992 Constitution. Articles 78 (1) and 79 (1) MENSAH v ATTORNEY-GENERAL [1997-98] 1 GLR 227 The Plaintiff, brought an action against the Attorney-General for a declaration that: on a true and proper interpretation of articles 78(1) and 79(1), of the Constitution, 1992, no person could after 6 January 1997 act as a minister or deputy minister of state without the prior approval of the Second Parliament of the Fourth Republic of his appointment. Therefore no person can be a minister or deputy minister of state unless prior approval has been granted by Parliament. Accordingly, any person who has not been so approved and appointed cannot lawfully act or hold himself out as a minister or deputy minister of state. The Court held that \u201cprior approval\u201d is not a term of art and does not necessarily imply \u201cconsideration and vetting\u201d. \u201cPrior approval\u201d are ordinary words which must be interpreted in their ordinary sense. Although the expression \u201cprior approval\u201d was not defined in the Constitution 1992, it could not have been the intention of the framers of the Constitution, 1992 that it should necessarily imply consideration and vetting whenever it had been used in any provision of the Constitution because of the variety of definitions the world[sic] \u201capprove\u201d had been given in the Consultative Assembly and that interpretation could not be consistently applied in all the provisions of the Constitution where the expression \u201cprior approval\u201d was used. Thus the term \u201cprior approval\u201d was not a term of art. But the common-sense implication of the expression was to obtain the consent of the relevant authority. See Articles 57(3), 58(1) and (3), 66(1) 76(1) and (2) 78(1), 79(1), 80, 81, 97(1), 100(1) and 113(1) and (3) Article 88 MENSAH v ATTORNEY-GENERAL [1997-98] 1 GLR 227 The Constitution, 1992, articles 58(1) and (4), 60, 78 and 79 created a government of an Executive President. And thus the term of office of the Executive President was the term of office of that government. Accordingly, the term of office of the Executive President was the term of office of those who constituted the government that is the Vice-President, ministers and deputy ministers. Therefore, the term of a minister or deputy minister was coterminous with that of the government which appointed him or her. Thus article 81 of the Constitution, 1992 provided for circumstances under which the office of a minister or deputy minister would become vacant within the tenure of office of the government under which he or she was serving. Accordingly, the contention that unless the office of a minister or deputy minister became vacant in any of the ways provided for in article 81 of the Constitution, 1992 he had an indefinite term of office, was untenable and inconsistent with the government structure provided for in the Constitution, 1992.

The court held that the Constitution 1992 makes no reservation to exclude convictions for contempt of court from the application of Article 72. Criminal contempt is an offence and attracts criminal penalties as a misdemeanour, whether it is charged under Article 126(2) of the Constitution or section 224 of Act 29; the consequences are the same. The court relied on the case of Republic v. Numapau; Ex Parte Ameyaw and Others (1999-2000) GLR 283 where the court stated that contempt of court has all the characteristics of a crime, hence there is the need for a prima facie case to be made out before all available defences may be considered. Consequently, it is an offence within the meaning of article 72 of the 1992 Constitution. Therefore, the prerogative of mercy extends to persons convicted of criminal contempt Besides all that has been said, the standard of proof required in a charge of scandalising the court, scurrilous publication about a judge and all matters that bring the administration of justice into public ridicule and hatred or interfere with the administration of justice is proof beyond a reasonable doubt, the same standard as in all criminal offences. See: ACKAH V. ACHEAMPONG & ANOTHER [2005-2006] SCGLR 1 REPUBLIC V. NUMAPAU; EX PARTE AMEYAW AND OTHERS (1999-2000) GLR 283; (1998-99) SCGLR 639; REPUBLIC V. ALHASSAN; EX PARTE ABBEY (1989-90) 1 GLR 139; GBADAMOSI V. MOHAMMADU (1991) 1 GLR 283. Whether or not the prerogative of mercy of the President of the Republic under article 72 of the Constitution, 1992, extends to and covers a power to grant pardon to persons, who have been convicted for contempt of court, by the Superior Courts under article 126(2) of the Constitution, 1992. The court has already held that contempt is an offence within the meaning of article 72 of the 1992 Constitution. Therefore the prerogative of mercy extends to persons convicted of criminal contempt Whether or not, if the President\u2019s prerogative of mercy under article 72 of the Constitution, 1992, extends to, and covers, a power to grant pardon to persons so committed and convicted, such power or prerogative of mercy is discretionary in terms of article 296 of the Constitution, 1992 and ought to be exercised in accordance with article 296(a) & (b) thereof. Article 296(c) applies particularly to persons to whom the Constitution has ascribed some duties involving the use of discretion, without prescribing how those duties are to be performed or supervised. The practice has been that the advisory bodies to the President must have rules and regulations to guide their functions. The rationale for article 296 is to check the abuse of discretionary power. Thus in situations where the Constitution itself provides the safeguards like the instant case ( Article 72 \u201cthe president acts in consultation with the Council of State\u201d), it is our opinion that the use of the said power must be viewed in the light of the safeguards provided and where it is found that the safeguards were complied with, then that power would be deemed to have been properly utilised in terms of the said provision unless there is clear evidence that the advice to the President was tainted in some way, as stated above. The safeguard under Article 72 is the consultation with the Council of State which seems to have been satisfied in this case. And we do not have any evidence that the Council of State was in any way unlawfully influenced in its opinion to the President, which would undermine the exercise of the discretion Therefore, discretionary power in article 72 when used in accordance with its provisions, such exercise of the power of mercy will not be questioned by the Courts. Hence, so far as the exercise of the power under article 72 does not infringe any provisions in the Constitution, the Courts will not interfere. Whether or not the grant of remission of the sentence of the contemnors by the President constitutes an unjustified interference with the judiciary and an affront to the Constitution. The independence of the judiciary relates to its core mandate, that of administering justice, and with it its administrative support. Indeed the judicial power has been explained in article 125(4) to mean jurisdiction in all matters, civil and criminal, including matters relating to this Constitution, and such other jurisdiction as Parliament may, by law, confer on it. The judiciary is entirely free in taking judicial decisions and that is where its independence is guaranteed by the Constitution. But after the act or decision, the Constitution says these could be tampered with in appropriate cases, and it is the court's duty to respect the limitation on the power enjoyed by each organ, including the Judiciary. Thus it is in the course of performing this core mandate that the judiciary is completely insulated against any external interference. In criminal matters, the process of adjudication ends in a trial court after sentence is pronounced. After the imposition of a jail term on a person, the execution of the sentence is by executive action, and not judicial. Criminal Contempt of court is a public wrong, in as much as high treason or robbery is, so it is unreasonable to suggest that the people would allow the President to pardon for all criminal offences except criminal contempt of court, without using express words to that effect. In our view, if it was intended that conviction for contempt of court should be excluded, clear words to that effect would have been employed. It is thus a total misconception and misapplication of the doctrine of judicial independence to suggest that the judiciary is an island unto itself in the scheme of governance under the concept of separation of powers.","title":"Article 72"},{"location":"Chapter%20Eight/#article-75","text":"MARGARET BANFUL AND HENRY NANA BOAKYE VRS.

J1/13/2018 5TH MAY, 2020 The Plaintiff contends that the Agreement between the Government of the Republic of Ghana and the United States of America on Defence Co-operation which was submitted to Parliament for ratification under Article 75 of the Constitution was not signed by the State parties and for that matter it was not an executed agreement envisaged under Article 75 of the 1992 Constitution. Plaintiff argued that the Executive should have executed the Agreement before submitting same to Parliament for ratification and its failure rendered the ratification unconstitutional, null and void having breached Article 75 of the Constitution. The Court relied on the very useful guide that had been laid by this [Supreme] Court and Section 10 of the Interpretation Act, 2009 Act 792, the court is of the view that the intention of the framers of the 1992 Constitution will be achieved if the court adopted a very flexible and purposeful approach in interpreting Article 75 of the 1992 Constitution. The Supreme Court held that in substance the document which was submitted by the Executive to Parliament though \"unsigned\" was an agreement that created legal obligations between the Republic of Ghana and the United States of America because the constitution did not stipulate any special format for such agreements apart from the use of the term \u2018executed\u2019, which only refers to signatures. The court held that the Agreement did not contravene Article 75 of the 1992 Constitution neither did the submission of the unsigned international agreement to Parliament for ratification by the Executive contravened Article 75 and any provision of the 1992 Constitution. Articles 78 (1) and 79 (1) MENSAH v ATTORNEY-GENERAL [1997-98] 1 GLR 227 The Plaintiff, brought an action against the Attorney-General for a declaration that: on a true and proper interpretation of articles 78(1) and 79(1), of the Constitution, 1992, no person could after 6 January 1997 act as a minister or deputy minister of state without the prior approval of the Second Parliament of the Fourth Republic of his appointment. Therefore no person can be a minister or deputy minister of state unless prior approval has been granted by Parliament. Accordingly, any person who has not been so approved and appointed cannot lawfully act or hold himself out as a minister or deputy minister of state. The Court held that \u201cprior approval\u201d is not a term of art and does not necessarily imply \u201cconsideration and vetting\u201d. \u201cPrior approval\u201d are ordinary words which must be interpreted in their ordinary sense. Although the expression \u201cprior approval\u201d was not defined in the Constitution 1992, it could not have been the intention of the framers of the Constitution, 1992 that it should necessarily imply consideration and vetting whenever it had been used in any provision of the Constitution because of the variety of definitions the world[sic] \u201capprove\u201d had been given in the Consultative Assembly and that interpretation could not be consistently applied in all the provisions of the Constitution where the expression \u201cprior approval\u201d was used. Thus the term \u201cprior approval\u201d was not a term of art. But the common-sense implication of the expression was to obtain the consent of the relevant authority. See Articles 57(3), 58(1) and (3), 66(1) 76(1) and (2) 78(1), 79(1), 80, 81, 97(1), 100(1) and 113(1) and (3)","title":"Article 75(1), (2)"},{"location":"Chapter%20Eight/#article-88","text":"MENSAH v ATTORNEY-GENERAL [1997-98] 1 GLR 227 The Constitution, 1992, articles 58(1) and (4), 60, 78 and 79 created a government of an Executive President. And thus the term of office of the Executive President was the term of office of that government. Accordingly, the term of office of the Executive President was the term of office of those who constituted the government that is the Vice-President, ministers and deputy ministers. Therefore, the term of a minister or deputy minister was coterminous with that of the government which appointed him or her. Thus article 81 of the Constitution, 1992 provided for circumstances under which the office of a minister or deputy minister would become vacant within the tenure of office of the government under which he or she was serving. Accordingly, the contention that unless the office of a minister or deputy minister became vacant in any of the ways provided for in article 81 of the Constitution, 1992 he had an indefinite term of office, was untenable and inconsistent with the government structure provided for in the Constitution, 1992.

The word Commission appearing in chapter 18 of the Constitution is used in two senses. In Articles 216 and 217, it must refer to the three persons, namely the Commissioner and the two Deputy Commissioners. In particular, when Article 217 speaks of appointing the members of the Commission, it can only be a reference to these 3 persons. But where Article 220 provides for the creation of regional and district branches of the Commission, this can only refer to something which can have branches. It will lead to manifest absurdity if the word \"Commission\" were interpreted to mean the three persons would have branches. In this context, the word must refer to an organization, a body, an institution, an establishment or a bureaucracy. Now, obviously, the people who will man the regional and district branches cannot be the Commission in the narrow sense of the Commissioner and his two deputies. It must refer to the wider sense in which the Commission is used. This will include the narrow sense Commission and the supporting staff and employees. Indeed, the appointment of officers and other employees of the Commission mentioned in Article 226 can only be a meaningful activity if such employees and officers are going to share in the execution of the functions of the Commission. The Commission in the wider sense is a bureaucracy established all over the country to carry out the functions spelt out in ## Article 218.","title":"Chapter Eighteen"},{"location":"Chapter%20Eighteen/#article-216-commission-on-human-rights-and-administrative-justice","text":"There shall be established by Act of Parliament within six months after Parliament first meets after the coming into force of this Constitution, a Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice which shall consist of - (a) A Commissioner for Human Rights and Administrative Justice; and (b) Two Deputy Commissioners for Human Rights and Administrative Justice","title":"Article 216 COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND ADMINISTRATIVE JUSTICE"},{"location":"Chapter%20Eighteen/#article-217-appointment-of-members-of-commission","text":"The President shall appoint the members of the Commission under article 70 of this Constitution.","title":"Article 217 APPOINTMENT OF MEMBERS OF COMMISSION"},{"location":"Chapter%20Eighteen/#article-218-functions-of-commission","text":"The functions of the Commission shall be defined and prescribed by Act of Parliament and shall include the duty.

The word Commission appearing in chapter 18 of the Constitution is used in two senses. In Articles 216 and 217, it must refer to the three persons, namely the Commissioner and the two Deputy Commissioners. In particular, when Article 217 speaks of appointing the members of the Commission, it can only be a reference to these 3 persons. But where Article 220 provides for the creation of regional and district branches of the Commission, this can only refer to something which can have branches. It will lead to manifest absurdity if the word \"Commission\" were interpreted to mean the three persons would have branches. In this context, the word must refer to an organization, a body, an institution, an establishment or a bureaucracy. Now, obviously, the people who will man the regional and district branches cannot be the Commission in the narrow sense of the Commissioner and his two deputies. It must refer to the wider sense in which the Commission is used. This will include the narrow sense Commission and the supporting staff and employees. Indeed, the appointment of officers and other employees of the Commission mentioned in Article 226 can only be a meaningful activity if such employees and officers are going to share in the execution of the functions of the Commission.

REPUBLIC V SPECIAL TRIBUNAL; EX PARTE AKOSAH [1980] GLR 592 Per Anin JA an issue of enforcement or interpretation of a provision of the Constitution arises in any of the following eventualities: (a) where the words of the provision are imprecise or unclear or ambiguous. Put in another way, it arises if one party invites the court to declare that the words of the article have a double-meaning or are obscure or else mean something different from or more than what they say; (b) where the rival meanings have been placed by the litigants on the words of any provision of the Constitution; (c) where there is a conflict in the meaning and effect of two or more articles of the Constitution, and the question is raised as to which provision should prevail; (d) where on the face of the provisions, there is a conflict between the operation of particular institutions set up under the Constitution, and thereby raising problems of enforcement and of interpretation.

Per Wood JSC The clear thinking of this court is that, our supervisory jurisdiction under article 132 of the 1992 constitution, should be exercised only in those manifestly plain and obvious cases, where there are patent errors of law on the face of the record, which errors either go to jurisdiction or are so plain as to make the impugned decision a complete nullity.\u201d She explained further that: \"...It stands to reason then that the error(s) of law as alleged must be fundamental, substantial, material, grave or so serious as to go to the root of the matter. A minor, trifling, inconsequential or unimportant error which does not go to the core or root of the decision complained of; or, stated differently, on which the decision does not turn would not attract the courts supervisory jurisdiction. Power of Supreme Court to Review its Decisions Article 133 MECHANICAL LLOYD ASSEMBLY PLANT V NARTEY [1987-88] 2 GLR 598, SC, Per Adade JSC The mere fact that a judgment can be criticized is no ground for asking that it should be reviewed. The review jurisdiction is a special jurisdiction to be exercised in exceptional circumstances. It is not an appellate jurisdiction. It is a kind of jurisdiction held in reserve, to be prayed in aid in the exceptional situation where a fundamental and basic error must have occasioned a gross miscarriage of justice. Article 133 OPOKU & OTHERS (NO.3) V AXEX CO. LTD (NO.3) [2013-2014] SCGLR 95 Per Akamba JSC The review jurisdiction avails an applicant where there are exceptional circumstances which if un-redressed would perpetuate a miscarriage of justice. It is not another avenue for re-arguing or repeating or refashioning previous arguments as in an appeal. Nor is it an opportunity for a party to revisit and come out with more ingenious arguments which he believes will find favour with the tribunal. Simply put a review is not an opportunity to have another bite at the cherry. AMIDU (No.3) v ATTORNEY-GENERAL, WATERVILLE HOLDINGS (BVI) LTD & WOYOME (No.3) [2013-2014] 1 SCGLR 606 Per Dotse, JSC Exceptional circumstances are: (a) compelling and exceptional circumstances dictated by the interests of justice, and; (b) exceptional circumstances where the demands of justice made the exercise extremely necessary to avoid irreparable damage. KARBOE V AMOSA (J4/56/2014) [2016] GHASC 13 (21 April 2016) Review Motion. Per Appau JSc Though there is no exact definition as to what \u2018exceptional circumstances\u2019 means, where there is the appearance of denial of justice or absence of justice in any manner or form, then the \u2018exceptional circumstances\u2019 criterion would have been established. The paramount consideration is; the existence of the absence or denial of justice. ARTHUR (No. 2) v ARTHUR (No 2) [2013-2014] SCGLR 569 at 579-580, Per Dotse, JSC We are therefore constrained to send a note of caution to all those who apply for the review jurisdiction of this Court under rule 54(a) of the Supreme Court Rules, 1996 (C.I. 16), to be mindful of the following which we set out as a road map. It is neither an exhaustive list nor one that is cast in iron such that it cannot be varied depending upon circumstances of each case: (i)in the first place, it must be established that the review application was filed within the time limits specified in rule 55 of C.I. 16, i.e. it shall be filed at the Registry of the Supreme Court not later than one month from the date of the decision sought to be reviewed; (ii) that there exists exceptional circumstances to warrant a consideration of the application; (iii) that these exceptional circumstances have led to some fundamental or basic error in the judgment of the ordinary bench; (iv) that these have resulted into miscarriage of justice (it could be gross miscarriage or miscarriage of justice simpliciter); (v) the review process should not be turned into another avenue as a further appeal against the decision of the ordinary bench; and (vi) the review process should not be used as a forum for unsuccessful litigants to re-argue their case. See Supreme Court Civil Procedure Rules, 1996 (C.I. 16) Supervisory Jurisdiction of the High Court over Lower Administrative Bodies Article 141 AKITA & ANOTHER VS. THE REPUBLIC BANK & ANOTHER [2013-2015] 2 GLR 824 Whenever a person asserts that an institution of State has failed to observe due process in making a decision which negatively affects that Person, an application for judicial review will be appropriate to right the wrong. Removal of Justices of the Superior Court. Article 146(6) FRANK AGYEI TWUM V ATTORNEY-GENERAL BRIGHT AKWETEY [2005-2006] SCGLR 227 Article 146(3) affords Justices of the Superior Court procedural safeguards whereby the President is required to refer a petition for the removal of a Justice of the Superior Court to the Chief Justice to determine whether there is a prima facie case before a panel is appointed to investigate the matter. There is no compelling reason why such procedural protection should not be accorded the Chief Justice who is first and foremost of the Superior Court. Failure to do so may erode the whole spectrum of the benefits of security of tenure that Article 146(1) seeks to accord the Justices of the Superior Courts. It is obvious that the drafters of the constitution made an inadvertent omission.","title":"Chapter Eleven"},{"location":"Chapter%20Eleven/#article-125-the-judicial-power-of-ghana","text":"(1) Justice emanates from the people and shall be administered in the name of the Republic by the Judiciary which shall be independent and subject only to this Constitution.

J6/04/2017 28TH FEBRUARY, 2018 Per PWAMANG JSC This case is a reference to the court of a question relating to interpretation and enforcement of Article 18(2) of the 1992 Constitution by the Magistrate of the District Court \"A\" Sunyani according to Article 130(2) of the Constitution. The question referred to the Supreme Court was; \"Whether the secret recording of the conversation between the plaintiff and the Superintendent Minister and representative of the third defendant was made in violation of clause (2) of Article 18 of the 1992 Constitution and therefore unconstitutional and inadmissible?\u201d In other words, does the secret recording of telephone conversation by a party to the conversation which is the situation in the instant case constitutes a breach of Article 18(2) of the constitution, 1992. The court held that the elements of the right of privacy protects the individual against unwanted intrusion, scrutiny and publicity and guarantees his control over intrusions into his private sphere. This means that it is up to the individual, subject of course to statutory laws made for the public good as stated in Article 18(2) itself, to decide if there should be any intrusion into, scrutiny or publicity of his private life including his communication. It is further up to the individual to determine the extent and manner of such permitted intrusion, scrutiny or publicity. When a person talks on the telephone to another the conversation is meant to be oral communication since if the speaker wanted the speech in a permanent form he could elect to write it down or record and send to the other person. It would be wrong for the person at the other end to assume that the speaker has waived his rights of privacy and consented to him recording the conversation and rendering it in a permanent state. Therefore, to record someone with whom you are having a telephone conversation is to interfere with his privacy beyond what he has consented to. In a similar vein, it would amount to a breach of privacy to put your phone on loudspeaker for the listening of third parties when you have a telephone conversation with another person because to so would be causing an intrusion into the caller's private sphere beyond what she consented to. Before recording someone or allowing third parties to listen to what he says on the telephone, his consent must be sought or he must be informed such that he can decide to end the call if he does not want to be recorded or heard by third parties. Therefore secret recording amounted to a violation of the right to privacy which has been guaranteed by Article 18(2) of the Constitution. Furthermore, the Court had to decide whether the recording which has been obtained in violation of the constitutional rights of the Superintendent Minister ought to be excluded from the evidence being led in the case although its contents are relevant to the matters in contention. The court held that in determining whether impugned evidence could bring the administration of justice into disrepute or make proceedings unfair, the court must consider all the circumstances of the case; paying attention to the nature of the right that has been violated and the manner and degree of the violation, either deliberate or innocuous; the gravity of the crime being tried and the manner the accused committed the offence as well as the severity of the sentence the offence attracts. The impact that exclusion of the evidence may have on the outcome of the case, particularly in civil cases where the establishment of the facts is of a high premium. These factors to be considered in determining whether to exclude or admit evidence obtained in breach of human rights are not exhaustive but are only to serve as guides to courts. For instance, where the offence the evidence is offered to prove is a grievous crime committed in a gruesome manner and the infraction of the accused person's right by the police was unavoidable, in the absence of countervailing factors, the public interest would require that a court leans towards allowing the evidence since it would bring the administration of justice into disrepute in the thinking of the public to exclude such evidence. But where in a civil case, while the case is pending or at the time the dispute was raging, one of the parties with a view to procuring evidence in support of his case in court obtains evidence in violation of the human rights of his opponent, that is conduct that could also bring the administration of justice into disrepute. Applying the above principles to the facts of the case at hand, it appears from the record that the plaintiff secretly recorded the Superintendent Minister with a view to using the evidence in court against him. To allow such deliberate violation of rights would encourage litigants to sidestep the rules of evidence and thereby undermine the integrity of court proceedings and bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The plaintiff certainly would have alternative means of adducing evidence in proof of his case and he should not be allowed to benefit from this intentional violation of the human rights of his opponent in the case. Our conclusion could have been otherwise if there were countervailing factors but on the facts of this case, the secret recording ought not to be allowed. In his statement of the case before us, the plaintiff offered no justification whatsoever for his interference with the privacy of the Superintendent Minister. Article 19 RE EFFIDUASE STOOL AFFAIRS (NO 2), REPUBLIC V ODURO NIMAPUA, PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL HOUSE OF CHIEFS; EX PARTE AMEYAW II (NO. 2) [1998-99] SCGLR 630 AT 670, Acquah JSC (as he then was) on behalf of the Supreme Court said as follows: \u201cFor one of the basic principles of any civilized system of justice is that a person is entitled to a fair trial free from prejudice. No system of justice can be effective unless a fair trial to both sides is ensured\u2026 This common law right to a fair trial is now elevated to a fundamental right in the 1992 Constitution of Ghana.\u201d Article 19 (2) (e) and (g) THE REPUBLIC VRS EUGENE BAFFOE-BONNIE AND OTHERS [2018] GHASC 40 On a proper and true interpretation of ## Article 19 (2) (e) and (g), we hold that it is inherent in the right to a fair trial, of an accused person\u2019s right to be given adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence as well as facilities to examine in person or by his [or her]lawyer. The court held that in order to meet the requirement of fair trial in criminal matters, it is the duty of the prosecution in both indictment and summary trials, to disclose to the defence, statements made to the police by persons who will or may not be called to testify as witnesses for the prosecution, as well as copies of exhibits and documents which are to be offered in evidence for the prosecution.The list of documents specified by the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) in her brief would therefore not meet this requirement. The prosecution must make disclosures available to the accused person in view of the fact that summary trial may commence within 48 hours upon arrest and charges being proffered against the accused. But the duty to disclose is not absolute; the prosecution has discretion to withhold material on grounds of relevance and privilege. Failure to disclose a material before tendering it in evidence does not render the material inadmissible, but should result in an adjournment to enable the accused to study the evidence or material before it can be used by the prosecution. Article 21(1) (d) NEW PATRIOTIC PARTY v INSPECTOR-GENERAL OF POLICE [1993-94] 2 GLR 459 Per Charles Hayfron-Benjamin JSC, In construing Article 21(1) (d) and (4) of the Constitution, 1992, therefore, it is clear that (1) the concept of consent or permit as prerequisites for the enjoyment of the fundamental human right to assemble, process or demonstrate is outside their purview. Section 7 and 8 of NRCD 68 are consequently patently inconsistent with the letter and spirit of the provisions of Article 21(d) of the Constitution, 1992 and are unconstitutional, void and unenforceable; (2) some restrictions as are provided for by Article 21(4) of the Constitution, 1992 may be necessary from time to time and upon proper occasion. But the right to assemble, process or demonstrate cannot be denied. The sections of NRCD 68 which formed the basis of the plaintiff\u2019s writ were ex facie Per Amua-Sekyi JSC, I would have thought that it was self-evident that the continued enjoyment by any community of fundamental human rights was incompatible with any requirement that a permit or licence has power to refuse it. No one would regard a law which required that workers should seek the prior permission of their employers before organising themselves in trade unions as a reasonable restriction on their right to freedom of association. Any such restriction on the right to freedom of assembly would make it meaningless and a sham. Based as they are on a requirement that permission be sought of the executive or one of its agencies before the right to freedom of assembly is exercised, sections 7, 8, 12(a) and 13 of NRCD 68 are clearly inconsistent with Article 21(1)(d) of the Constitution, 1992. Article 21 (1) (e) MENSIMA AND OTHERS V ATTORNEY-GENERAL AND OTHERS [1997-98] 1 GLR 159 Articles 21(1)(e) and 24(3) of the Constitution, 1992 entitled every worker to form or join a trade union of his choice for the promotion and protection of his economic and social interest. However, Article 24(4) of the Constitution, 1992 legitimised, inter alia, laws which were reasonably necessary to maintain the equilibrium between the competing interest and rights of the individual and that of the State. The compulsory requirement of membership could not be justified in terms of Article 21(4)(c) of the Constitution, 1992, regulation 3(1) of LI 239 the Manufacture and Sale of Spirits Regulations, 1962 (LI 239) was inconsistent with the letter and spirit of the Constitution, 1992, particularly Article 21(1) (e) thereof Article 21(1) (g) NANA ADJEI AMPOFO V THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL HOUSE OF CHIEFS [2011] 2 SCGLR 1104 Section 63 (d) of the Chieftaincy Act, 2008 Act 759 states that, a crime is committed if a person deliberately refuses to honour a call from a chief to attend to an issue is an encroachment on the liberty generally and freedom of movement in particular of citizens and accordingly in contravention of and or inconsistent with the spirit and letter of Articles 21(1) (g) of the Constitution of the Republic of Ghana, 1992 Article 23 AWUNI v WAEC [2003-2004] 1 SCGLR 471 Sophia Akuffo, JSC (as she then was) opined as follows: \u201cIn my view, the scope of Article 23 Is such that there is no distinction made between acts done in exercise of ordinary administrative functions and quasi-judicial administrative functions. Where a body or officer has an administrative function to perform, the activity must be conducted with, and reflect the qualities of fairness, reasonableness and legal compliance. I will not venture to give a comprehensive definition of what is fair and reasonable, since these qualities are dictated by the circumstances in which the administrative function is performed. At the very least however, it includes probity, transparency, objectivity, opportunity to be heard, legal competence and absence of bias, caprice or ill-will. In particular, where, as in this case, the likely outcome of an administrative activity is of a penal nature, no matter how strong the suspicion of the commission of the offence, it is imperative that all affected persons be given reasonable notice of the allegations against them and reasonable opportunity to be heard, if the objective of Article 23 is to be achieved\u201d. See: CAPTAN v MINISTER OF INTERIOR SC. 16.1.70. Article 296 Article 33(1) ADJEI-AMPOFO (NO. 1) V ACCRA METROPOLITAN ASSEMBLY AND ATTORNEY-GENERAL (NO 1) [2007-08] I SCGLR 611 Although the High Court's jurisdiction in Article 140(2) appears to be very broad, the provision is nothing more than a practical restatement of the exception to the Supreme Court's jurisdiction, as defined by Article 130(1), in cases brought under Article 2(1), The High Court enforcement power is, therefore, to be exercised within the scope of Article 33(1), the language of which is clear. Hence the emphasis we must not lose sight of in Article 33(1) is the phrase \"in relation to him.\" In other words, in the High Court, the actual, ongoing or threatened contravention of the fundamental human rights or freedom must be in relation to the plaintiff and none else. However, where the human right or freedom sought to be enforced is not in relation to the plaintiff\u2019s personal rights and freedoms, but for the purpose of enforcing a provision of the Constitution under Article 2(1), the proper court is the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court\u2019s jurisdiction in such a case is determined by whether or not the plaintiff is pursuing a personal interest.

GYASI COMPANY LIMITED, ASSEMBLY OF GOD CHURCH REFERENCE NO. J6/04/2017 28TH FEBRUARY, 2018 Per PWAMANG JSC This case is a reference to the court of a question relating to interpretation and enforcement of Article 18(2) of the 1992 Constitution by the Magistrate of the District Court \"A\" Sunyani according to Article 130(2) of the Constitution. The question referred to the Supreme Court was; \"Whether the secret recording of the conversation between the plaintiff and the Superintendent Minister and representative of the third defendant was made in violation of clause (2) of Article 18 of the 1992 Constitution and therefore unconstitutional and inadmissible?\u201d In other words, does the secret recording of telephone conversation by a party to the conversation which is the situation in the instant case constitutes a breach of Article 18(2) of the constitution, 1992. The court held that the elements of the right of privacy protects the individual against unwanted intrusion, scrutiny and publicity and guarantees his control over intrusions into his private sphere. This means that it is up to the individual, subject of course to statutory laws made for the public good as stated in Article 18(2) itself, to decide if there should be any intrusion into, scrutiny or publicity of his private life including his communication. It is further up to the individual to determine the extent and manner of such permitted intrusion, scrutiny or publicity. When a person talks on the telephone to another the conversation is meant to be oral communication since if the speaker wanted the speech in a permanent form he could elect to write it down or record and send to the other person. It would be wrong for the person at the other end to assume that the speaker has waived his rights of privacy and consented to him recording the conversation and rendering it in a permanent state. Therefore, to record someone with whom you are having a telephone conversation is to interfere with his privacy beyond what he has consented to. In a similar vein, it would amount to a breach of privacy to put your phone on loudspeaker for the listening of third parties when you have a telephone conversation with another person because to so would be causing an intrusion into the caller's private sphere beyond what she consented to. Before recording someone or allowing third parties to listen to what he says on the telephone, his consent must be sought or he must be informed such that he can decide to end the call if he does not want to be recorded or heard by third parties. Therefore secret recording amounted to a violation of the right to privacy which has been guaranteed by Article 18(2) of the Constitution. Furthermore, the Court had to decide whether the recording which has been obtained in violation of the constitutional rights of the Superintendent Minister ought to be excluded from the evidence being led in the case although its contents are relevant to the matters in contention. The court held that in determining whether impugned evidence could bring the administration of justice into disrepute or make proceedings unfair, the court must consider all the circumstances of the case; paying attention to the nature of the right that has been violated and the manner and degree of the violation, either deliberate or innocuous; the gravity of the crime being tried and the manner the accused committed the offence as well as the severity of the sentence the offence attracts. The impact that exclusion of the evidence may have on the outcome of the case, particularly in civil cases where the establishment of the facts is of a high premium. These factors to be considered in determining whether to exclude or admit evidence obtained in breach of human rights are not exhaustive but are only to serve as guides to courts. For instance, where the offence the evidence is offered to prove is a grievous crime committed in a gruesome manner and the infraction of the accused person's right by the police was unavoidable, in the absence of countervailing factors, the public interest would require that a court leans towards allowing the evidence since it would bring the administration of justice into disrepute in the thinking of the public to exclude such evidence. But where in a civil case, while the case is pending or at the time the dispute was raging, one of the parties with a view to procuring evidence in support of his case in court obtains evidence in violation of the human rights of his opponent, that is conduct that could also bring the administration of justice into disrepute. Applying the above principles to the facts of the case at hand, it appears from the record that the plaintiff secretly recorded the Superintendent Minister with a view to using the evidence in court against him. To allow such deliberate violation of rights would encourage litigants to sidestep the rules of evidence and thereby undermine the integrity of court proceedings and bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The plaintiff certainly would have alternative means of adducing evidence in proof of his case and he should not be allowed to benefit from this intentional violation of the human rights of his opponent in the case. Our conclusion could have been otherwise if there were countervailing factors but on the facts of this case, the secret recording ought not to be allowed. In his statement of the case before us, the plaintiff offered no justification whatsoever for his interference with the privacy of the Superintendent Minister.","title":"Article 18(2)"},{"location":"Chapter%20Five/#article-19","text":"RE EFFIDUASE STOOL AFFAIRS (NO 2), REPUBLIC V ODURO NIMAPUA, PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL HOUSE OF CHIEFS; EX PARTE AMEYAW II (NO. 2) [1998-99] SCGLR 630 AT 670, Acquah JSC (as he then was) on behalf of the Supreme Court said as follows: \u201cFor one of the basic principles of any civilized system of justice is that a person is entitled to a fair trial free from prejudice.

The court held that in order to meet the requirement of fair trial in criminal matters, it is the duty of the prosecution in both indictment and summary trials, to disclose to the defence, statements made to the police by persons who will or may not be called to testify as witnesses for the prosecution, as well as copies of exhibits and documents which are to be offered in evidence for the prosecution.The list of documents specified by the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) in her brief would therefore not meet this requirement. The prosecution must make disclosures available to the accused person in view of the fact that summary trial may commence within 48 hours upon arrest and charges being proffered against the accused. But the duty to disclose is not absolute; the prosecution has discretion to withhold material on grounds of relevance and privilege. Failure to disclose a material before tendering it in evidence does not render the material inadmissible, but should result in an adjournment to enable the accused to study the evidence or material before it can be used by the prosecution.","title":"Article 19 (2) (e) and (g)"},{"location":"Chapter%20Five/#article-211-d","text":"NEW PATRIOTIC PARTY v INSPECTOR-GENERAL OF POLICE [1993-94] 2 GLR 459 Per Charles Hayfron-Benjamin JSC, In construing Article 21(1) (d) and (4) of the Constitution, 1992, therefore, it is clear that (1) the concept of consent or permit as prerequisites for the enjoyment of the fundamental human right to assemble, process or demonstrate is outside their purview.

Where a body or officer has an administrative function to perform, the activity must be conducted with, and reflect the qualities of fairness, reasonableness and legal compliance. I will not venture to give a comprehensive definition of what is fair and reasonable, since these qualities are dictated by the circumstances in which the administrative function is performed.

In particular, where, as in this case, the likely outcome of an administrative activity is of a penal nature, no matter how strong the suspicion of the commission of the offence, it is imperative that all affected persons be given reasonable notice of the allegations against them and reasonable opportunity to be heard, if the objective of Article 23 is to be achieved\u201d.

When LI 1983 was laid before Parliament, Parliament referred it to its Committee on Subsidiary Legislation, per its Standing Orders. The rule is that after 21 days, LI 1983 automatically came into force. In the instant case, by the time the LI came into force, the number of electoral areas in Ledzekuku had been increased to 16 while the electoral areas for Krowor remained as twelve. By increasing the numbers, Parliament, through the Subsidiary Legislation Committee, had interfered with the LI as laid before Parliament. The main question raised in this case was how far Parliament could interfere with such legislation when it is laid before it for 21 days under the 1992 Constitution. It is that source or the framers of the LI that has the power to amend the legislation. This is supported by the 1992 Constitution, article 297(d). In the instant case, what Parliament did by increasing the number on the electoral area of Ledzekuku from twelve to sixteen amounted to amending the Regulation laid before it. There is no provision in article 11(7) quoted above for Parliament to amend the Regulation as laid before it. Parliament is authorized to annul the Regulations by the votes of two-thirds of the members of Parliament. To the extent that Parliament amended the Local Government (Creation of New District Electoral Areas and Designation of Units Instrument, 2010 (LI 1983) differently from what was laid before Parliament instead of annulling it, the LI is ultra vires article 11(7) of the 1992 Constitution.

Interpretation/Insight Article 1(2) Article 2(1) TUFFOUR v ATTORNEY-GENERAL [1980] GLR 637 The plaintiff is seeking a declaration from this court that on the coming into force of the Constitution of the Third Republic on 24 September 1979, Fred Kwasi Apaloo was deemed to have been appointed Chief Justice of the Republic and as such became president and member of the Supreme Court; The defendants raise a preliminary objection to the capacity of the plaintiff. That a person asking for a relief had to have a cause of action for which a relief could be granted. The plaintiff was, however, claiming no relief for himself and had no interest in the case. The person who had an exclusive interest was Fred Kwasi Apaloo and the plaintiff had no community of interest with him. There was no inherent right for a person to ask for a declaration at common law. His writ had to show some form of relief. Even if the declaration was made it would not be binding since the plaintiff and Fred Kwasi Apaloo had no community of interest. The Court held that whether or not Fred Kwasi Apaloo was the Chief Justice was not a private right. The interest of the plaintiff was a constitutional right exercisable by all citizens of Ghana by virtue of article 1 of the Constitution. And the plaintiff under article 1, need not have any community of interest with any person or authority. His community of interest was with the Constitution. Article 2(1) NEW PATRIOTIC PARTY v ATTORNEY-GENERAL [1997-98] 1 GLR 378 - 461 COUNCIL OF INDIGENOUS BUSINESS ASSOCIATIONS (CIBA) Case The plaintiff, the New Patriotic Party, a political party registered under the laws of Ghana as a body corporate, issued a writ to invoke the original jurisdiction under articles 2(1) and 130 of the Constitution, 1992 for a declaration that: \"The Council of Indigenous Business Associations Law, 1993 (PNDCL 312) is inconsistent with and a contravention of, the Constitution, especially articles 21 (1) (e), 35(1), 37(2)(a) and (3), and that consequently, to the extent of such inconsistency, the said PNDCL 312 is void. The Attorney-General raised a preliminary issue to the effect that the New Patriotic Party has no capacity or locus to commence an action under article 2(1) of the Constitution, 1992 on the ground that only a natural person can bring such an action. The Court held that A \"person\" as defined in Section 32 of the Interpretation Act, 1960 (CA 4) to include a body corporate. Since that meaning fitted the context in which \"person\" was used in ## Article 2(1) of the Constitution, 1992 there was no necessity for applying the canons of statutory interpretation to determine its meaning. Moreover, the word \"person\" had been defined in ## Article 297 of the Constitution, 1992 to include a natural as well as a legal person or a corporate person such as the plaintiff. Accordingly, the plaintiff had locus in the case under ## Article 2(1). Article 2(1) SAM v ATTORNEY-GENERAL (No 2) [1999-2000] 2 GLR 336, [2000] SCGLR 305 The plaintiff, a citizen of Ghana, issued a writ to invoke the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under article 2(1) of the Constitution, 1992 for a declaration that section 15 of the Divestiture of State Interests (Implementation) Law, 1992 (PNDCL 326) was inconsistent with or in contravention of the provisions of article 140(1) and 293(2) of the Constitution, 1992 and to that extent, it was null and void The Attorney-General, the defendant, raised a preliminary objection to the plaintiff\u2019s action on the ground, inter alia, that the plaintiff had no standing to bring the suit since he had no personal interest in the outcome of the case, and consequently invited the court to strike out the plaintiff\u2019s writ for lack of standing The court held that the original interpretive and enforcement jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under article 2(1) of the Constitution, 1992 was a special jurisdiction available to any citizen of Ghana irrespective of personal interest. Under article 2(1) of the Constitution, 1992 any person who was a citizen was entitled to bring a suit to the Supreme Court if he alleged that an enactment or anything contained in that enactment was inconsistent with or in contravention of the Constitution and to obtain a declaration to that effect. Hence other requirements for standing like the dispute or controversy requirement or the personal requirement were not necessary when invoking the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under article 2(1) of the Constitution, 1992. Hence other requirements for standing like the dispute or controversy requirement or the personal requirement were not necessary when invoking the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under article 2(1) of the Constitution, 1992. See FEDERATION OF YOUTH ASSOCIATION OF GHANA (FEDYAG) V PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES OF GHANA AND OTHERS (J1/5/2009) [2011] GHASC 53 Article 2(1) ADJEI-AMPOFO (NO. 1) V ACCRA METROPOLITAN ASSEMBLY AND ATTORNEY-GENERAL (NO 1) [2007-08] I SCGLR 611 The Plaintiff claim under article 2(1) that the practice whereby the first Defendant, Accra Metropolitan Assembly (AMA) employed certain persons to remove or carry on their heads human faeces from residents in various parts of the Accra Metropolis is unconstitutional because it is against article 15(1) and (2) of the 1992 constitution. The first defendant raised a preliminary objection to the Plaintiff's action on the grounds that the plaintiff had no locus standi (standing to bring the matter before the court) in the matter. The court also has no jurisdiction to entertain the case since the plaintiff\u2019s action rested on article 15(1) and (2) which falls under Chapter Five of the fundamental human rights and freedoms. Therefore the High Court is the appropriate avenue for the case. The court held that the actions of the first defendant violate article 15(1) and (2) of the 1992 Constitution of Ghana. Again, the court held that the objective of Article 2(1) of the 1992 constitution was to foster the enforcement of all provisions of the constitution by encouraging all Ghanaians (whether natural persons or corporate) to access the original jurisdiction of the supreme court in the interest of the general public. The outcome of an action under article 2(1) is beneficial to the citizenry in general and it might not necessarily inure to the benefit of the Plaintiff therein. Furthermore, the court held that although the High Court's jurisdiction in Article 140(2) appears to be very broad, the provision is nothing more than a practical restatement of the exception to the Supreme Court's jurisdiction, as defined by Article 130(1), in cases brought under Article 2(1). The High Court enforcement power is, therefore, to be exercised within the scope of Article 33(1), the language of which is clear. Hence the emphasis we must not lose sight of in Article 33(1) is the phrase \"in relation to him.\" In other words, in the High Court, the actual, ongoing or threatened contravention of the fundamental human rights or freedom must be in relation to the plaintiff and none else. However, where the human right or freedom sought to be enforced is not in relation to the plaintiff\u2019s personal rights and freedoms, but for the purpose of enforcing a provision of the Constitution under Article 2(1), the proper court is the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court\u2019s jurisdiction in such a case is determined by whether or not the plaintiff is pursuing a personal interest.

Hence the emphasis we must not lose sight of in Article 33(1) is the phrase \"in relation to him.\" In other words, in the High Court, the actual, ongoing or threatened contravention of the fundamental human rights or freedom must be in relation to the plaintiff and none else. However, where the human right or freedom sought to be enforced is not in relation to the plaintiff\u2019s personal rights and freedoms, but for the purpose of enforcing a provision of the Constitution under Article 2(1), the proper court is the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court\u2019s jurisdiction in such a case is determined by whether or not the plaintiff is pursuing a personal interest.

Interpretation/Insight GHANA LOTTO OPERATORS ASSOCIATION & OTHERS V NATIONAL LOTTERY AUTHORITY (2007-2008) SCGLR 1088 Per Date-Bah Jsc Applying this presumption of justiciability, our view is that the economic objectives laid out in Article 36 of the Constitution are legally binding and are not merely a matter of conscience for successive governments of our land. The objectives have, though, to be liberally construed in order not to interfere with the democratic mandates of successive governments. Where, however, a government introduces legislation which is flagrantly at odds with any of the objectives set out in the Article, we believe that this Court has jurisdiction to strike down the provisions in the legislation which are incompatible with the objectives concerned. In short, Article 36(2) (b) is justiciable. See NEW PATRIOTIC PARTY V ATTORNEY-GENERAL (THE 31ST DECEMBER CASE) [1993-94] 2GLR 35 Adade JSC I am aware that this idea of the alleged non-justiciability of the directive principles is peddled very widely, but I have not found it convincingly substantiated anywhere. I have the uncomfortable feeling that this may be one of those cases where a falsehood, given sufficient currency, manages to pass for the truth. I do not subscribe to the view that chapter 6 of the Constitution, 1992 is not justiciable: it is. First, the Constitution, 1992 as a whole is a justiciable document. If any part is to be non-justiciable, the Constitution, 1992 itself must say so. I have not seen anything in chapter 6 or in the Constitution, 1992 generally, which tells me that chapter 6 is not justiciable. The evidence to establish the non-justiciability must be internal to the Constitution, 1992, not otherwise, for the simple reason that if the proffered proof is external to the Constitution, 1992, it must of necessity conflict with it, and be void and inadmissible: we cannot add words to the Constitution in order to change its meaning.\u201d NEW PATRIOTIC PARTY V ATTORNEY-GENERAL (THE CIBA CASE). [1997-98] 1GLR 378 Bamford-Addo JSC in \u201cThe question which should be posed is whether the provisions of chapter 6 have any separate existence of their own, i.e. whether they are of and by themselves justiciable or enforceable? Most of those provisions relate to the enjoyment of the guaranteed fundamental rights and freedoms set out in chapter 5 of the Constitution, 1992. As stated by the drafters of the Constitution, 1992 the directive principles have no separate existence\u037e They are measures by which laws are judged for constitutionality and they afford a yardstick by which policy decisions are to be taken and implemented for the establishment of a just and free society. This means that until they are read and applied in conjunction with any substantive guaranteed human rights and freedoms set out in chapter 5 of the Constitution, 1992, they remain only guidelines, and are not enforceable rights by themselves. In general therefore it is correct to say that the directive principles are principles of state policy which taken together constitute a sort of barometer by which the people can measure the performance of their government. That they provide goals for legislature programmes and a guide for judicial interpretation but are not of and by themselves legally enforceable by any court. However, there are exceptions to this general principle. Since the courts are mandated to apply them in their interpretative duty, when they are read together or in conjunction with other enforceable parts of the Constitution, 1992, they then in that sense, become enforceable. But as clearly explained in the Report, standing independently they are not justiciable.

I have the uncomfortable feeling that this may be one of those cases where a falsehood, given sufficient currency, manages to pass for the truth. I do not subscribe to the view that chapter 6 of the Constitution, 1992 is not justiciable: it is. First, the Constitution, 1992 as a whole is a justiciable document. If any part is to be non-justiciable, the Constitution, 1992 itself must say so. I have not seen anything in chapter 6 or in the Constitution, 1992 generally, which tells me that chapter 6 is not justiciable. The evidence to establish the non-justiciability must be internal to the Constitution, 1992, not otherwise, for the simple reason that if the proffered proof is external to the Constitution, 1992, it must of necessity conflict with it, and be void and inadmissible: we cannot add words to the Constitution in order to change its meaning.\u201d NEW PATRIOTIC PARTY V ATTORNEY-GENERAL (THE CIBA CASE). [1997-98] 1GLR 378 Bamford-Addo JSC in \u201cThe question which should be posed is whether the provisions of chapter 6 have any separate existence of their own, i.e. whether they are of and by themselves justiciable or enforceable? Most of those provisions relate to the enjoyment of the guaranteed fundamental rights and freedoms set out in chapter 5 of the Constitution, 1992. As stated by the drafters of the Constitution, 1992 the directive principles have no separate existence\u037e They are measures by which laws are judged for constitutionality and they afford a yardstick by which policy decisions are to be taken and implemented for the establishment of a just and free society. This means that until they are read and applied in conjunction with any substantive guaranteed human rights and freedoms set out in chapter 5 of the Constitution, 1992, they remain only guidelines, and are not enforceable rights by themselves. In general therefore it is correct to say that the directive principles are principles of state policy which taken together constitute a sort of barometer by which the people can measure the performance of their government. That they provide goals for legislature programmes and a guide for judicial interpretation but are not of and by themselves legally enforceable by any court. However, there are exceptions to this general principle. Since the courts are mandated to apply them in their interpretative duty, when they are read together or in conjunction with other enforceable parts of the Constitution, 1992, they then in that sense, become enforceable. But as clearly explained in the Report, standing independently they are not justiciable.

This is to afford us the opportunity to enforce the provisions of article 187 (7) (b) which will deepen probity and accountability. According to Article 187 (7) (b) (i) of the Constitution, the Auditor-General is bound to issue a disallowance or surcharge where there has been any item of expenditure on behalf of the Government that is contrary to law. According to Article 187 (7) (b) (ii) of the Constitution, the Auditor-General is bound to issue a disallowance and surcharge where any person fails to bring any sum into the Government\u2019s account. Furthermore, the Auditor-General under Article 187 (7) (b) (iii) of the Constitution, the Auditor-General is bound to issue a disallowance and surcharge where the Government suffers or incurs a loss or deficiency through the negligence or misconduct of any person Article 187 HON. P. C. APPIAH-OFORI v. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL [2/06/2010] WRIT NO. J1/4/2007 The Supreme Court held that the Auditor-General is a public officer within the contemplation of Articles 70, 71, 146 and 286 and not within the contemplation of Articles 144 and 145 which deal with the Judiciary, in particular, Superior Court Judges. According to Article 70, the mode of appointment, the oath of office, emoluments, independence, removal from office among others of the Auditor-General places him in the same category of the following officers, the Chairman of the Electoral Commission, Commission for Civic Education, Public Service Commission, etc. These officers have their age of retirement pegged with that of a Justice of a Court of Appeal but the Auditor-General does not share the same age of retirement. The Constitution of Ghana, 1992 does not provide for the retirement age for the Auditor-General. But Article 199(1) of the Constitution, 1992 provides that: \u201cA public officer shall except as otherwise provided in this Constitution, retire from Public Service on attaining the age of sixty years.\u201d Furthermore, Section 10 (4) of the Audit Service Act (Act 584) amplifies Article 199(1). Section 10 (4) states that \u201cThe Auditor-General shall retire after attaining the age of sixty years but may be engaged for a limited period of not more than two years at a time but not exceeding five years in all on any other terms and conditions that the President, acting in consultation with the Council of State, shall determine.\u201d See Article 70, 71, 146, 144, 145, 199, 286, Audit Service Act, 2000 (Act 584)","title":"Chapter Thirteen"},{"location":"Chapter%20Thirteen/#article-174-taxation","text":"(1) No taxation shall be imposed otherwise than by or under the authority of an Act of Parliament.

The Constitution of Ghana, 1992 does not provide for the retirement age for the Auditor-General.

Article 299 TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS The transitional provisions specified in the First Schedule to this Constitution shall have effect notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Constitution Interpretation/Insight Article 296 (c) RANSFORD FRANCE (No. 3) VRS. THE ELECTORAL COMMISSION AND THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL WRIT No. J1/19/ 2012 19TH OCTOBER, 2012 The plaintiff sought for a declaration that upon a true and proper interpretation of Articles 23, 51 and 296 (c), the first defendant in the exercise of its functions and discretionary power in creating new constituencies, is required to make by Constitutional Instrument, regulations not inconsistent with the Constitution or any other law to govern the exercise of its discretionary power. Again, the plaintiff sought for an order declaring as null, void and of no effect the Representation of the People (Parliamentary Constituencies) Instrument, 2012, C.I. 78 as having been made in contravention of Articles 23, 51 and 296 (c) of the Constitution, 1992. The court held that such an expansive literal interpretation would lead to grave mischief. Because invalidity as a result of non-compliance with the literal meaning of article 296(c) would appear to occur automatically since what is contemplated is the unconstitutionality of an act which conflicts with a provision of the Constitution. The invalidity of an enactment flows as an inevitable consequence of its non-compliance with a provision of the Constitution. This would lead to a nuclear melt-down, so to speak, of government, as we have known it since 1969. Literally, thousands of decisions already taken by public officials and agencies since 1969 would be rendered invalid and would have to be declared so by this Court (because the Exercise of Discretionary Power was first introduced as part of the Proposals of the Constitutional Commission for a Constitution of Ghana in 1968). These invalid decisions would include the last creation of additional constituencies in 2004, by the Representation of the People (Parliamentary Constituencies) Instrument, 2004 (CI 46). Thus, article 173(c) of the 1969 Constitution, if literally interpreted, would seem to require that before any discretion is exercised by a public official or agency, the official or agency must first publish regulations governing the exercise of that discretion. It is also possible to interpret the proposal from the 1968 Constitutional Commission\u2019s Proposals as supporting such an expansive literal interpretation when the Commission says: \u201cWe, therefore, propose that when discretionary power is given to any person or authority that person should publish a statutory instrument which will set out the principles, the manner and the mode of the exercise of the discretionary power conferred\u201d. But this would be thoroughly impractical for public officials and agencies in general to publish regulations governing their discretions before they could exercise them, on pain of the invalidity of those discretionary decisions. The obligation to make regulations should be limited to discretions that are exercised in quasi-judicial situations. Furthermore, the court has not seen any other constitutional provision that the Representation of the People (Parliamentary Constituencies) Instrument, 2012, C.I. 78 infringes. The plaintiff has not set out to make, nor has he succeeded in making, a case that the first defendant has not measured up to the constitutional standards prescribed in article 296(a) and (b) for the exercise of discretion. There has been no proof that either the duty to be fair and candid or to refrain from arbitrariness, capriciousness or bias has been breached. Accordingly, since the discretion that has been exercised by the Electoral Commission is not quasi-judicial, the obligation imposed by article 296(c) should not apply to it. See: AWUNI v WAEC [2003-2004] 1 SCGLR 471 CAPTAN v MINISTER OF INTERIOR SC. 16.1.70. See: KPEBU V ATTORNEY GENERAL (J1/13/2015) [2016] GHASC 15 (05 MAY 2016) on the legal effects of a declaration of unconstitutionality. KPEBU V ATTORNEY GENERAL (J1/13/2015) [2016] GHASC 15 (05 MAY 2016) Per G. T. WOOD (MRS) CHIEF JUSTICE As a general rule, a declaration of unconstitutionality applies both retrospectively and prospectively. Under the doctrine of prospective overruling, this court has the power to decide whether, to limit the retroactive effect of the declaration of invalidity. The rationale for this rule is to provide a pragmatic solution to total chaos or anarchy, inconvenience, hardship and injustice in the administration of justice, following a declaration of unconstitutionality, in those clearly bona fide cases where issues had been determined in the honest belief that the impugned legislation was a valid law. A key factor that should influence the invocation of the rule is the extent of the entrenchment of the existing rule. Invoking the doctrine would thus prevent an indiscriminate wholesale nullification of long-standing settled issues and decisions based on the invalidated law, a potential source for large scale re-litigation of settled rights and obligations and a multiplicity of suits. We (the Supreme Court) have the constitutional authority to determine whether our decision shall operate prospectively or retrospectively. It derives from article 1 clause (2), sub-clause (2) of the 1992 Constitution, which provides: \u201cThe Supreme Court, shall for the purposes of a declaration under clause (1) of this article, make such orders and give such directions as it may consider appropriate for giving effect, or enabling effect to be given, to the declaration so made.\u201d In this instant case, where the impugned legislation has been applied in a large number of cases over a long period of time, I urge that we avoid a strict retroactive application of our decision, to avert a wholesale re-opening of settled issues and prolonged litigation concerning all persons being held in pre-trial detention under the impugned section 96 (7) of Act 30. In order to avert a crisis in the administration of justice, the full effects of this decision must be managed in a way that would not overburden our already distressed criminal justice system. I have confidence that the full scope and applicability of the doctrine will be explored, developed and clarified through case law, as had been done in other jurisdictions.","title":"Chapter Twenty-Six"},{"location":"Chapter%20Twenty-Six/#article-293-claims-against-government","text":"(1) Where a person has a claim against the Government, that claim may be enforced as of right by proceedings taken against the Government for that purpose without the grant of a fiat or the use of the process known as petition of right.

THE ELECTORAL COMMISSION AND THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL WRIT No. J1/19/ 2012 19TH OCTOBER, 2012 The plaintiff sought for a declaration that upon a true and proper interpretation of Articles 23, 51 and 296 (c), the first defendant in the exercise of its functions and discretionary power in creating new constituencies, is required to make by Constitutional Instrument, regulations not inconsistent with the Constitution or any other law to govern the exercise of its discretionary power. Again, the plaintiff sought for an order declaring as null, void and of no effect the Representation of the People (Parliamentary Constituencies) Instrument, 2012, C.I. 78 as having been made in contravention of Articles 23, 51 and 296 (c) of the Constitution, 1992. The court held that such an expansive literal interpretation would lead to grave mischief. Because invalidity as a result of non-compliance with the literal meaning of article 296(c) would appear to occur automatically since what is contemplated is the unconstitutionality of an act which conflicts with a provision of the Constitution. The invalidity of an enactment flows as an inevitable consequence of its non-compliance with a provision of the Constitution. This would lead to a nuclear melt-down, so to speak, of government, as we have known it since 1969. Literally, thousands of decisions already taken by public officials and agencies since 1969 would be rendered invalid and would have to be declared so by this Court (because the Exercise of Discretionary Power was first introduced as part of the Proposals of the Constitutional Commission for a Constitution of Ghana in 1968). These invalid decisions would include the last creation of additional constituencies in 2004, by the Representation of the People (Parliamentary Constituencies) Instrument, 2004 (CI 46). Thus, article 173(c) of the 1969 Constitution, if literally interpreted, would seem to require that before any discretion is exercised by a public official or agency, the official or agency must first publish regulations governing the exercise of that discretion. It is also possible to interpret the proposal from the 1968 Constitutional Commission\u2019s Proposals as supporting such an expansive literal interpretation when the Commission says: \u201cWe, therefore, propose that when discretionary power is given to any person or authority that person should publish a statutory instrument which will set out the principles, the manner and the mode of the exercise of the discretionary power conferred\u201d. But this would be thoroughly impractical for public officials and agencies in general to publish regulations governing their discretions before they could exercise them, on pain of the invalidity of those discretionary decisions. The obligation to make regulations should be limited to discretions that are exercised in quasi-judicial situations. Furthermore, the court has not seen any other constitutional provision that the Representation of the People (Parliamentary Constituencies) Instrument, 2012, C.I. 78 infringes. The plaintiff has not set out to make, nor has he succeeded in making, a case that the first defendant has not measured up to the constitutional standards prescribed in article 296(a) and (b) for the exercise of discretion. There has been no proof that either the duty to be fair and candid or to refrain from arbitrariness, capriciousness or bias has been breached. Accordingly, since the discretion that has been exercised by the Electoral Commission is not quasi-judicial, the obligation imposed by article 296(c) should not apply to it. See: AWUNI v WAEC [2003-2004] 1 SCGLR 471 CAPTAN v MINISTER OF INTERIOR SC. 16.1.70. See: KPEBU V ATTORNEY GENERAL (J1/13/2015) [2016] GHASC 15 (05 MAY 2016) on the legal effects of a declaration of unconstitutionality. KPEBU V ATTORNEY GENERAL (J1/13/2015) [2016] GHASC 15 (05 MAY 2016) Per G. T. WOOD (MRS) CHIEF JUSTICE As a general rule, a declaration of unconstitutionality applies both retrospectively and prospectively. Under the doctrine of prospective overruling, this court has the power to decide whether, to limit the retroactive effect of the declaration of invalidity. The rationale for this rule is to provide a pragmatic solution to total chaos or anarchy, inconvenience, hardship and injustice in the administration of justice, following a declaration of unconstitutionality, in those clearly bona fide cases where issues had been determined in the honest belief that the impugned legislation was a valid law. A key factor that should influence the invocation of the rule is the extent of the entrenchment of the existing rule. Invoking the doctrine would thus prevent an indiscriminate wholesale nullification of long-standing settled issues and decisions based on the invalidated law, a potential source for large scale re-litigation of settled rights and obligations and a multiplicity of suits. We (the Supreme Court) have the constitutional authority to determine whether our decision shall operate prospectively or retrospectively. It derives from article 1 clause (2), sub-clause (2) of the 1992 Constitution, which provides: \u201cThe Supreme Court, shall for the purposes of a declaration under clause (1) of this article, make such orders and give such directions as it may consider appropriate for giving effect, or enabling effect to be given, to the declaration so made.\u201d In this instant case, where the impugned legislation has been applied in a large number of cases over a long period of time, I urge that we avoid a strict retroactive application of our decision, to avert a wholesale re-opening of settled issues and prolonged litigation concerning all persons being held in pre-trial detention under the impugned section 96 (7) of Act 30. In order to avert a crisis in the administration of justice, the full effects of this decision must be managed in a way that would not overburden our already distressed criminal justice system. I have confidence that the full scope and applicability of the doctrine will be explored, developed and clarified through case law, as had been done in other jurisdictions.","title":"Article 296 (c)"},{"location":"Chapter%20Twenty-Three/","text":"CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE COMMISSIONS OF INQUIRY COMMISSIONS OF INQUIRY Article 278 APPOINTMENT OF COMMISSION OF INQUIRY (1) Subject to article (5) of this Constitution, the President shall, by constitutional instrument, appoint a commission of inquiry into any matter of public interest where- (a) The President is satisfied that a commission of inquiry should be appointed; or (b) The Council of State advises that it is in the public interest to do so; or (c) Parliament, by a resolution requests that a commission of inquiry be appointed to inquire into any matter, specified in the resolution as being a matter of public importance.
