REPUBLIC V COURT OF APPEAL; EX PARTE TSATSU TSIKATA [2005-2006] SCGLR 612.

Per Wood JSC 

The clear thinking of this court is that, our supervisory jurisdiction under article 132 of the 1992 constitution, should be exercised only in those manifestly plain and 
obvious cases, where there are patent errors of law on the face of the record, which errors either go to jurisdiction or are so plain as to make the impugned decision a complete nullity.”
She explained further that:
"...It stands to reason then that the error(s) of law as alleged must be fundamental, substantial, material, grave or so serious as to go to the root of the matter.
 A minor, trifling, inconsequential or unimportant error which does not go to the core or root of the decision complained of; or, stated differently, on which the decision 
does not turn would not attract the courts supervisory jurisdiction.


Power of Supreme Court to Review its Decisions

##  Article 133

MECHANICAL LLOYD ASSEMBLY PLANT V NARTEY [1987-88] 2 GLR 598, SC, 

Per Adade JSC 

The mere fact that a judgment can be criticized is no ground for asking that it should be reviewed. The review jurisdiction is a special jurisdiction to be exercised in exceptional circumstances. It is not an appellate jurisdiction. It is a kind of jurisdiction held in reserve, to be prayed in aid in the exceptional situation where a fundamental and basic error must have occasioned a gross miscarriage of justice.

##  Article 133 

OPOKU & OTHERS (NO.3) V AXEX CO. LTD (NO.3) [2013-2014] SCGLR 95 

Per Akamba JSC 

The review jurisdiction avails an applicant where there are exceptional circumstances which if un-redressed would perpetuate a miscarriage of justice. It is not another avenue for re-arguing or repeating or refashioning previous arguments as in an appeal. Nor is it an opportunity for a party to revisit and come out with more ingenious arguments which he believes will find favour with the tribunal. Simply put a review is not an opportunity to have another bite at the cherry.


AMIDU (No.3) v ATTORNEY-GENERAL, WATERVILLE HOLDINGS (BVI) LTD & WOYOME (No.3) [2013-2014] 1 SCGLR 606 

Per Dotse, JSC 

Exceptional circumstances are: 

(a) compelling and exceptional circumstances dictated by the interests of justice, and;

(b) exceptional circumstances where the demands of justice made the exercise extremely necessary to avoid irreparable damage.


KARBOE V AMOSA (J4/56/2014) [2016] GHASC 13 (21 April 2016) Review Motion.

Per Appau JSc  

Though there is no exact definition as to what ‘exceptional circumstances’ means, where there is the appearance of denial of justice or absence of justice in any manner or form, then the ‘exceptional circumstances’ criterion would have been established.

The paramount consideration is; the existence of the absence or denial of justice.


ARTHUR (No. 2) v ARTHUR (No 2) [2013-2014] SCGLR 569 at 579-580, 

Per Dotse, JSC

We are therefore constrained to send a note of caution to all those who apply for the review jurisdiction of this Court under rule 54(a) of the Supreme Court Rules, 1996 (C.I. 16), to be mindful of the following which we set out as a road map. It is neither an exhaustive list nor one that is cast in iron such that it cannot be varied depending upon circumstances of each case:

(i)in the first place, it must be established that the review application was filed within the time limits specified in rule 55 of C.I. 16, i.e. it shall be filed at the Registry of the Supreme Court not later than one month from the date of the decision sought to be reviewed;

(ii) that there exists exceptional circumstances to warrant a consideration of the application;

(iii) that these exceptional circumstances have led to some fundamental or basic error in the judgment of the ordinary bench;

(iv) that these have resulted into miscarriage of justice (it could be gross miscarriage or miscarriage of justice simpliciter);

(v) the review process should not be turned into another avenue as a further appeal against the decision of the ordinary bench; and

(vi) the review process should not be used as a forum for unsuccessful litigants to re-argue their case.

See 
Supreme Court Civil Procedure Rules, 1996 (C.I. 16)


Supervisory Jurisdiction of the High Court over Lower Administrative Bodies

##  Article 141

AKITA & ANOTHER VS. THE REPUBLIC BANK & ANOTHER [2013-2015] 2 GLR 824

Whenever a person asserts that an institution of State has failed to observe due process in making a decision which negatively affects that Person, an application for judicial review will be appropriate to right the wrong.


Removal of Justices of the Superior Court.

##  Article 146(6)

FRANK AGYEI TWUM V ATTORNEY-GENERAL BRIGHT AKWETEY  [2005-2006] SCGLR 227 


Article 146(3) affords Justices of the Superior Court procedural safeguards whereby the President is required to refer a petition for the removal of a Justice of the Superior Court to the Chief Justice to determine whether there is a prima facie case before a panel is appointed to investigate the matter. There is no compelling reason why such procedural protection should not be accorded the Chief Justice who is first and foremost of the Superior Court. Failure to do so may erode the whole spectrum of the benefits of security of tenure that   Article 146(1) seeks to accord the Justices of the Superior Courts. It is obvious that the drafters of the constitution made an inadvertent omission.
