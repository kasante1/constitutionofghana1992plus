##  Article 293 CLAIMS AGAINST GOVERNMENT

(1) Where a person has a claim against the Government, that claim may be enforced as of right by proceedings taken against the Government for that purpose without the grant of a fiat or the use of the process known as petition of right.

(2) The Government shall be subject to all those liabilities in tort to which, if it were a private person of full age and capacity, it would be subject -

(a) in respect of torts committed by its employees or agents;

(b) In respect of a breach of duties which a person owes to his employees or agents at common law or under any other law by reason of being their employer; and

(c) In respect of a breach of the duties at common law or under any other law attached to the ownership, occupation, possession or control of property.

(3) No proceedings shall lie against the Government by virtue of paragraph (a) of clause (2) of this article in respect of an act or omission of an employee or agent of the Government unless the act or omission would, apart from this article, have given rise to a cause of action in tort against that employee or his estate.

(4) Where the Government is bound by a statutory duty which is binding also upon persons other than the Government and its officers, the Government shall, in respect of a failure to comply with that duty, be subject to all liabilities in tort to which it would be so subject if the Government were a private person of full age and capacity.

(5) Where functions are conferred or imposed on an officer of the Government as such officer either by a rule of the common law or by statute and that officer commits tort while performing or purporting to perform those functions, the liabilities of the Government in respect of the tort shall be what they would have been if the function had been conferred or imposed solely by virtue of instructions lawfully given by the Government.

(6) No proceedings shall lie against the Government by virtue of this article in respect of -

(a) Anything done or omitted to be done by any person while discharging or purporting to discharge responsibilities of a judicial nature vested in him; or

(b) Any act, neglect or default of an officer of the Government unless that officer-

(i) has been directly or indirectly appointed by the Government and was, at the material time, paid in respect of his duties as an officer of the Government wholly out of public funds or out of moneys provided by Parliament; or

(ii) Was, at the material time, holding an office in respect of which the Public Services Commission certifies that the holder of that office would normally be so paid.

(7) Where the Government is subject to a liability by virtue of this article, the law relating to indemnity and contribution shall be enforceable-

(a) against the Government by an employee of the Government who is acting in the proper execution of his duties in respect of the liability or by any other person in respect of the liability to which that person is subject; or

(b) by the Government against any person other than an employee of the Government, in respect of the liability to which it is so subject, as if the Government were a private person of full age and capacity.

## Interpretation/Insight


##  Article 296 (c)

RANSFORD FRANCE (No. 3) VRS. THE ELECTORAL COMMISSION AND THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL WRIT No. J1/19/ 2012 19TH OCTOBER, 2012
 
The plaintiff sought for a declaration that upon a true and proper interpretation of Articles 23, 51 and 296 (c), the first defendant in the exercise of its functions and discretionary power in creating new constituencies, is required to make by Constitutional Instrument, regulations not inconsistent with the Constitution or any other law to govern the exercise of its discretionary power. 
 
Again, the plaintiff sought for an order declaring as null, void and of no effect the Representation of the People (Parliamentary Constituencies) Instrument, 2012, C.I. 78 as having been made in contravention of Articles 23, 51 and 296 (c) of the Constitution, 1992.
 
The court held that such an expansive literal interpretation would lead to grave mischief. Because invalidity as a result of non-compliance with the literal meaning of article 296(c) would appear to occur automatically since what is contemplated is the unconstitutionality of an act which conflicts with a provision of the Constitution. The invalidity of an enactment flows as an inevitable consequence of its non-compliance with a provision of the Constitution. This would lead to a nuclear melt-down, so to speak, of government, as we have known it since 1969. Literally, thousands of decisions already taken by public officials and agencies since 1969 would be rendered invalid and would have to be declared so by this Court (because the Exercise of Discretionary Power was first introduced as part of the Proposals of the Constitutional Commission for a Constitution of Ghana in 1968). These invalid decisions would include the last creation of additional constituencies in 2004, by the Representation of the People (Parliamentary Constituencies) Instrument, 2004 (CI 46). 

Thus, article 173(c) of the 1969 Constitution, if literally interpreted, would seem to require that before any discretion is exercised by a public official or agency, the official or agency must first publish regulations governing the exercise of that discretion. It is also possible to interpret the proposal from the 1968 Constitutional Commission’s Proposals as supporting such an expansive literal interpretation when the Commission says: “We, therefore, propose that when discretionary power is given to any person or authority that person should publish a statutory instrument which will set out the principles, the manner and the mode of the exercise of the discretionary power conferred”. But this would be thoroughly impractical for public officials and agencies in general to publish regulations governing their discretions before they could exercise them, on pain of the invalidity of those discretionary decisions. The obligation to make regulations should be limited to discretions that are exercised in quasi-judicial situations.

Furthermore, the court has not seen any other constitutional provision that the Representation of the People (Parliamentary Constituencies) Instrument, 2012, C.I. 78 infringes. The plaintiff has not set out to make, nor has he succeeded in making, a case that the first defendant has not measured up to the constitutional standards prescribed in article 296(a) and (b) for the exercise of discretion. There has been no proof that either the duty to be fair and candid or to refrain from arbitrariness, capriciousness or bias has been breached.

Accordingly, since the discretion that has been exercised by the Electoral Commission is not quasi-judicial, the obligation imposed by article 296(c) should not apply to it.

KPEBU V ATTORNEY GENERAL (J1/13/2015) [2016] GHASC 15 (05 MAY 2016) on the legal effects of a declaration of unconstitutionality. 


KPEBU V ATTORNEY GENERAL (J1/13/2015) [2016] GHASC 15 (05 MAY 2016)
 
Per G. T. WOOD (MRS) CHIEF JUSTICE

As a general rule, a declaration of unconstitutionality applies both retrospectively and prospectively. Under the doctrine of prospective overruling, this court has the power to decide whether, to limit the retroactive effect of the declaration of invalidity. 
 
The rationale for this rule is to provide a pragmatic solution to total chaos or anarchy, inconvenience, hardship and injustice in the administration of justice, following a declaration of unconstitutionality, in those clearly bona fide cases where issues had been determined in the honest belief that the impugned legislation was a valid law. A key factor that should influence the invocation of the rule is the extent of the entrenchment of the existing rule. Invoking the doctrine would thus prevent an indiscriminate wholesale nullification of long-standing settled issues and decisions based on the invalidated law, a potential source for large scale re-litigation of settled rights and obligations and a multiplicity of suits.
 
We (the Supreme Court) have the constitutional authority to determine whether our decision shall operate prospectively or retrospectively. It derives from article 1 clause (2), sub-clause (2) of the 1992 Constitution, which provides:
 
“The Supreme Court, shall for the purposes of a declaration under clause (1) of this article, make such orders and give such directions as it may consider appropriate for giving effect, or enabling effect to be given, to the declaration so made.”
 
In this instant case, where the impugned legislation has been applied in a large number of cases over a long period of time, I urge that we avoid a strict retroactive application of our decision, to avert a wholesale re-opening of settled issues and prolonged litigation concerning all persons being held in pre-trial detention under the impugned section 96 (7) of Act 30. In order to avert a crisis in the administration of justice, the full effects of this decision must be managed in a way that would not overburden our already distressed criminal justice system. I have confidence that the full scope and applicability of the doctrine will be explored, developed and clarified through case law, as had been done in other jurisdictions.
