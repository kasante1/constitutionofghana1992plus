## Interpretation/Insight

##  Article 218(a)

REPUBLIC V HIGH COURT (FAST TRACK DIVISION) ACCRA; EX PARTE CHRAJ (ANANE INTERESTED PARTY) [2007-2008] SCGLR 213

"Complaint" is limited to formal complaints made to the Commission, by an identifiable complaint; not necessarily the victim, but an identifiable complainant, armed with a complaint. The Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice Act (Act 456),  and Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice; Complaints Procedure (Regulations) 1994, CI 7, fully sets out the details  of how these may be done. 


##  Article 218 (e)

COMMISION ON HUMAN RIGHT AND ADMINISTRATIVE JUSTICE VRS.
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND BABA KAMARA [2011] GHASC 19 (06 April 2011);

DATE-BAH, JSC
on a true and proper interpretation of   Article 218(e) of the 1992 Constitution the mandate of the plaintiff “to investigate all instances of alleged or suspected corruption and misappropriation of public moneys by officials” covers situations in which an individual, entity and/or person though not a “public official” is alleged to be involved or implicated in an act or alleged bribery or corruption involving public officials and which is under investigation by the Commission.

AKUFFO, JSC
If in the course of CHARJ’s investigation an instance of alleged or suspected corruption by public officials, a member of the private sector (natural or corporate) becomes enmeshed in the matter, CHRAJ will be duty bound to extend the scope of its investigation to cover the activities of such person, in order to plumb the full and true depth of the instance of ‘alleged or suspected corruption ... by officials.’

##  Article 216,217,218,220

SAMUEL APPIAH AMPOFO V COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND ADMINISTRATIVE JUSTICE (CHRAJ) [2005-2006] SCGLR 227

The court held that the Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice (Complaint Procedure Regulations, 1994 (C.1.7) C.1.7 properly confers investigative powers on officers and employees of the Commission other than the Commissioner and his two deputies.  The word Commission appearing in chapter 18 of the Constitution is used in two senses. In Articles 216 and 217, it must refer to the three persons, namely the Commissioner and the two Deputy Commissioners. In particular, when   Article 217 speaks of appointing the members of the Commission, it can only be a reference to these 3 persons. But where   Article 220 provides for the creation of regional and district branches of the Commission, this can only refer to something which can have branches. It will lead to manifest absurdity if the word "Commission" were interpreted to mean the three persons would have branches. In this context, the word must refer to an organization, a body, an institution, an establishment or a bureaucracy. Now, obviously, the people who will man the regional and district branches cannot be the Commission in the narrow sense of the Commissioner and his two deputies. It must refer to the wider sense in which the Commission is used. This will include the narrow sense Commission and the supporting staff and employees. Indeed, the appointment of officers and other employees of the Commission mentioned in   Article 226 can only be a meaningful activity if such employees and officers are going to share in the execution of the functions of the Commission. The Commission in the wider sense is a bureaucracy established all over the country to carry out the functions spelt out in ##  Article 218.
