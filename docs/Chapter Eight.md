## Interpretation/Insight


##  Article 70(1) (d) (iii)

THEOPHILUS DONKOR V THE ATTORNEY GENERAL [2019] GHASC 52

Upon a true and proper interpretation, a Public Service Officer appointed in accordance with   Article 195 of the Constitution and may not be removed save in accordance with the terms and conditions of his or her contract of engagement or in the absence of such, for "just cause‟ pursuant to Articles 191 and 195 of the Constitution. 

Members of governing boards of statutory boards and corporations appointed in accordance with   Article 70(1) (d) (iii) of the Constitution are not members of the Public Service and their tenure is not governed by Articles 191 and 195 of the Constitution.

Therefore, each person may be removed at will by the President. To the extent that Section 14 of the Presidential (Transition) Act 2012, (Act 845) requires Chief Executives or Directors-General (howsoever described) of public boards or corporations to cease to hold office upon the assumption of office by a person elected as President of the Republic of Ghana, the same is hereby declared to be unconstitutional and void for being in contravention of Articles 190 and 191 of the Constitution.

See
Article 190,191, 195. 


##  Article 72

AGBEMAVA, TUAH-YEBOAH, BEDIATUO VRS ATTORNEY GENERAL (J1/20/2016 J1/21/2016 J1/23/2016) [2018] GHASC 52 (21 November 2018)

1. Whether or not the words “convicted of an offence” in article 72 of the Constitution 1992 includes committal and conviction for the offence of contempt of court by the Superior Court under article 126(2) of the Constitution. 

The court held that the Constitution 1992 makes no reservation to exclude convictions for contempt of court from the application of   Article 72. Criminal contempt is an offence and attracts criminal penalties as a misdemeanour, whether it is charged under   Article 126(2) of the Constitution or section 224 of Act 29; the consequences are the same. The court relied on the case of Republic v. Numapau; Ex Parte Ameyaw and Others (1999-2000) GLR 283 where the court stated that contempt of court has all the characteristics of a crime, hence there is the need for a prima facie case to be made out before all available defences may be considered. Consequently, it is an offence within the meaning of article 72 of the 1992 Constitution. Therefore, the prerogative of mercy extends to persons convicted of criminal contempt

Besides all that has been said, the standard of proof required in a charge of scandalising the court, scurrilous publication about a judge and all matters that bring the administration of justice into public ridicule and hatred or interfere with the administration of justice is proof beyond a reasonable doubt, the same standard as in all criminal offences. 

See:
 
ACKAH V. ACHEAMPONG & ANOTHER [2005-2006] SCGLR 1 
REPUBLIC V. NUMAPAU; EX PARTE AMEYAW AND OTHERS (1999-2000) GLR 283; (1998-99) SCGLR 639; 
REPUBLIC V. ALHASSAN; EX PARTE ABBEY (1989-90) 1 GLR 139; GBADAMOSI V. MOHAMMADU (1991) 1 GLR 283. 

2. Whether or not the prerogative of mercy of the President of the Republic under article 72 of the Constitution, 1992, extends to and covers a power to grant pardon to persons, who have been convicted for contempt of court, by the Superior Courts under article 126(2) of the Constitution, 1992. 

The court has already held that contempt is an offence within the meaning of article 72 of the 1992 Constitution. Therefore the prerogative of mercy extends to persons convicted of criminal contempt


3. Whether or not, if the President’s prerogative of mercy under article 72 of the Constitution, 1992, extends to, and covers, a power to grant pardon to persons so committed and convicted, such power or prerogative of mercy is discretionary in terms of article 296 of the Constitution, 1992 and ought to be exercised in accordance with article 296(a) & (b) thereof. 

Article 296(c) applies particularly to persons to whom the Constitution has ascribed some duties involving the use of discretion, without prescribing how those duties are to be performed or supervised. The practice has been that the advisory bodies to the President must have rules and regulations to guide their functions.

The rationale for article 296 is to check the abuse of discretionary power. Thus in situations where the Constitution itself provides the safeguards like the instant case (  Article 72 “the president acts in consultation with the Council of State”), it is our opinion that the use of the said power must be viewed in the light of the safeguards provided and where it is found that the safeguards were complied with, then that power would be deemed to have been properly utilised in terms of the said provision unless there is clear evidence that the advice to the President was tainted in some way, as stated above.

The safeguard under   Article 72 is the consultation with the Council of State which seems to have been satisfied in this case. And we do not have any evidence that the Council of State was in any way unlawfully influenced in its opinion to the President, which would undermine the exercise of the discretion

Therefore, discretionary power in article 72 when used in accordance with its provisions, such exercise of the power of mercy will not be questioned by the Courts. Hence, so far as the exercise of the power under article 72 does not infringe any provisions in the Constitution, the Courts will not interfere.



4. Whether or not the grant of remission of the sentence of the contemnors by the President constitutes an unjustified interference with the judiciary and an affront to the Constitution.

The independence of the judiciary relates to its core mandate, that of administering justice, and with it its administrative support. Indeed the judicial power has been explained in article 125(4) to mean jurisdiction in all matters, civil and criminal, including matters relating to this Constitution, and such other jurisdiction as Parliament may, by law, confer on it. The judiciary is entirely free in taking judicial decisions and that is where its independence is guaranteed by the Constitution. But after the act or decision, the Constitution says these could be tampered with in appropriate cases, and it is the court's duty to respect the limitation on the power enjoyed by each organ, including the Judiciary. Thus it is in the course of performing this core mandate that the judiciary is completely insulated against any external interference. In criminal matters, the process of adjudication ends in a trial court after sentence is pronounced. After the imposition of a jail term on a person, the execution of the sentence is by executive action, and not judicial. Criminal Contempt of court is a public wrong, in as much as high treason or robbery is, so it is unreasonable to suggest that the people would allow the President to pardon for all criminal offences except criminal contempt of court, without using express words to that effect. In our view, if it was intended that conviction for contempt of court should be excluded, clear words to that effect would have been employed. It is thus a total misconception and misapplication of the doctrine of judicial independence to suggest that the judiciary is an island unto itself in the scheme of governance under the concept of separation of powers.


##  Article 75

MARGARET BANFUL AND HENRY NANA BOAKYE VRS. THE ATTORNEY- GENERAL

Writ No.J1/7/2016, Supreme Court, dated the 22nd June 2017

The Supreme Court was called upon to interpret whether documents exchanged between the Governments of Ghana and the United States of America described as ‘Note Verbal’ is in the category of agreements contemplated by   Article 75 of the 1992 Constitution, which therefore ought to have been submitted to Parliament for ratification.

Per Sophia Akuffo

‘’The Constitution makes no mention of any formal distinctions that are dependent on the formality with which such an instrument is formatted or brought into being.”

The Court held that a ‘Note Verbal’ exchanged between the Government of Ghana and the United States of America creates an obligation that binds the Republic of Ghana. Therefore, an international agreement has come into existence. 


##  Article 75(1), (2)

YAW BROGYA GYAMFI VRS THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL 

WRIT NO. J1/13/2018 5TH MAY, 2020

The Plaintiff contends that the Agreement between the Government of the Republic of Ghana and the United States of America on Defence Co-operation which was submitted to Parliament for ratification under   Article 75 of the Constitution was not signed by the State parties and for that matter it was not an executed agreement envisaged under   Article 75 of the 1992 Constitution. Plaintiff argued that the Executive should have executed the Agreement before submitting same to Parliament for ratification and its failure rendered the ratification unconstitutional, null and void having breached   Article 75 of the Constitution. 

The Court relied on the very useful guide that had been laid by this [Supreme] Court and Section 10 of the Interpretation Act, 2009 Act 792, the court is of the view that the intention of the framers of the 1992 Constitution will be achieved if the court adopted a very flexible and purposeful approach in interpreting   Article 75 of the 1992 Constitution. 

The Supreme Court held that in substance the document which was submitted by the Executive to Parliament though "unsigned" was an agreement that created legal obligations between the Republic of Ghana and the United States of America because the constitution did not stipulate any special format for such agreements apart from the use of the term ‘executed’, which only refers to signatures.

The court held that the Agreement did not contravene   Article 75 of the 1992 Constitution neither did the submission of the unsigned international agreement to Parliament for ratification by the Executive contravened   Article 75 and any provision of the 1992 Constitution.


Articles 78 (1) and 79 (1)

MENSAH v ATTORNEY-GENERAL [1997-98] 1 GLR 227

The Plaintiff, brought an action against the Attorney-General for a declaration that: on a true and proper interpretation of articles 78(1) and 79(1), of the Constitution, 1992, no person could after 6 January 1997 act as a minister or deputy minister of state without the prior approval of the Second Parliament of the Fourth Republic of his appointment.

Therefore no person can be a minister or deputy minister of state unless prior approval has been granted by Parliament. Accordingly, any person who has not been so approved and appointed cannot lawfully act or hold himself out as a minister or deputy minister of state.

The Court held that “prior approval” is not a term of art and does not necessarily imply “consideration and vetting”. “Prior approval” are ordinary words which must be interpreted in their ordinary sense. Although the expression “prior approval” was not defined in the Constitution 1992, it could not have been the intention of the framers of the Constitution, 1992 that it should necessarily imply consideration and vetting whenever it had been used in any provision of the Constitution because of the variety of definitions the world[sic] “approve” had been given in the Consultative Assembly and that interpretation could not be consistently applied in all the provisions of the Constitution where the expression “prior approval” was used. Thus the term “prior approval” was not a term of art. But the common-sense implication of the expression was to obtain the consent of the relevant authority.

##  Article 88 

MENSAH v ATTORNEY-GENERAL [1997-98] 1 GLR 227

The Constitution, 1992, articles 58(1) and (4), 60, 78 and 79 created a government of an Executive President. And thus the term of office of the Executive President was the term of office of that government. Accordingly, the term of office of the Executive President was the term of office of those who constituted the government that is the Vice-President, ministers and deputy ministers. Therefore, the term of a minister or deputy minister was coterminous with that of the government which appointed him or her. Thus article 81 of the Constitution, 1992 provided for circumstances under which the office of a minister or deputy minister would become vacant within the tenure of office of the government under which he or she was serving. Accordingly, the contention that unless the office of a minister or deputy minister became vacant in any of the ways provided for in article 81 of the Constitution, 1992 he had an indefinite term of office, was untenable and inconsistent with the government structure provided for in the Constitution, 1992.
