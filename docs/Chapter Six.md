## Interpretation/Insight

GHANA LOTTO OPERATORS ASSOCIATION & OTHERS V NATIONAL LOTTERY AUTHORITY (2007-2008) SCGLR 1088

Per Date-Bah Jsc

Applying this presumption of justiciability, our view is that the economic objectives laid out in   Article 36 of the Constitution are legally binding and are not merely a matter of conscience for successive governments of our land. The objectives have, though, to be liberally construed in order not to interfere with the democratic mandates of successive governments. Where, however, a government introduces legislation which is flagrantly at odds with any of the objectives set out in the Article, we believe that this Court has jurisdiction to strike down the provisions in the legislation which are incompatible with the objectives concerned. In short,   Article 36(2) (b) is justiciable.

NEW PATRIOTIC PARTY V ATTORNEY-GENERAL (THE 31ST DECEMBER CASE) [1993-94] 2GLR 35

Adade JSC

I am aware that this idea of the alleged non-justiciability of the directive principles is peddled very widely, but I have not found it convincingly substantiated anywhere. I have the uncomfortable feeling that this may be one of those cases where a falsehood, given sufficient currency, manages to pass for the truth.
I do not subscribe to the view that chapter 6 of the Constitution, 1992 is not justiciable: it is. First, the Constitution, 1992 as a whole is a justiciable document. If any part is to be non-justiciable, the Constitution, 1992 itself must say so. I have not seen anything in chapter 6 or in the Constitution, 1992 generally, which tells me that chapter 6 is not justiciable. The evidence to establish the non-justiciability must be internal to the Constitution, 1992, not otherwise, for the simple reason that if the proffered proof is external to the Constitution, 1992, it must of necessity conflict with it, and be void and inadmissible: we cannot add words to the Constitution in order to change its meaning.”


NEW PATRIOTIC PARTY V ATTORNEY-GENERAL (THE CIBA CASE). [1997-98] 1GLR 378 

Bamford-Addo JSC in

“The question which should be posed is whether the provisions of chapter 6 have any separate existence of their own, i.e. whether they are of and by themselves justiciable or enforceable? Most of those provisions relate to the enjoyment of the guaranteed fundamental rights and freedoms set out in chapter 5 of the Constitution, 1992. As stated by the drafters of the Constitution, 1992 the directive principles have no separate existence; They are measures by which laws are judged for constitutionality and they afford a yardstick by which policy decisions are to be taken and implemented for the establishment of a just and free society. This means that until they are read and applied in conjunction with any substantive guaranteed human rights and freedoms set out in chapter 5 of the Constitution, 1992, they remain only guidelines, and are not enforceable rights by themselves.
In general therefore it is correct to say that the directive principles are principles of state policy which taken together constitute a sort of barometer by which the people can measure the performance of their government. That they provide goals for legislature programmes and a guide for judicial interpretation but are not of and by themselves legally enforceable by any court. However, there are exceptions to this general principle. Since the courts are mandated to apply them in their interpretative duty, when they are read together or in conjunction with other enforceable parts of the Constitution, 1992, they then in that sense, become enforceable. But as clearly explained in the Report, standing independently they are not justiciable.
See also   Article 34 of the Constitution, 1992.”
