## Interpretation/Insight

PROFESSOR STEPHEN KWAKU ASARE VRS THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL

WRIT NO: J1/15/2015 14TH OCTOBER, 2015

Per Dotse JSC

The preamble can be taken to be in two parts, the operative and subordinate parts.

What I consider to be the operative and constitutive parts are the words 

“we the People of Ghana … Do hereby adopt, enact and give to ourselves this Constitution”.

The subordinate parts will be from the words:
 “In Exercise of our natural and inalienable right to establish... up to and including all the words therein to “The protection and preservation of fundamental Human Rights and Freedoms, Unity and Stability for our Nation.” 
 
 If the above preambular statements are considered alongside Article 1(1) of the Constitution 1992 … Then a full understanding of the philosophical underpinnings upon which the framers of the Constitution 1992 fashioned it out will be clearly seen… "
