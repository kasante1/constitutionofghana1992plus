##  Article 18(2) 

RAPHAEL CUBAGEE VRS MICHAEL YEBOAH ASARE, K. GYASI COMPANY LIMITED, ASSEMBLY OF GOD CHURCH REFERENCE NO. J6/04/2017 28TH FEBRUARY, 2018

Per PWAMANG JSC

This case is a reference to the court of a question relating to interpretation and enforcement of  Article 18(2) of the 1992 Constitution by the Magistrate of the  District Court "A" Sunyani according to  Article 130(2) of the Constitution.

The question referred to the Supreme Court was; "Whether the secret recording of the conversation between the plaintiff and the Superintendent Minister and representative of the third defendant was made in violation of clause (2) of  Article 18 of the 1992 Constitution
and therefore unconstitutional and inadmissible?”  In other words, does the secret recording of telephone conversation by a party to the conversation which is the situation in the instant case constitutes a breach of Article 18(2) of the constitution, 1992.

The court held that the elements of the right of privacy protects the individual against unwanted intrusion, scrutiny and publicity and guarantees his control over intrusions into his private sphere. This means that it is up to the individual, subject of course to statutory laws made for the public good as stated in Article 18(2) itself, to decide if there should be any intrusion into, scrutiny or publicity of his private life including his communication. 

It is further up to the individual to determine the extent and manner of such permitted intrusion, scrutiny or publicity. When a person talks on the telephone to another the conversation is meant to be oral communication since if the speaker wanted the speech in a permanent form he could elect to write it down or record and send to the other person. It would be wrong for the person at the other end to assume that the speaker has waived his rights of privacy and consented to him recording the conversation and rendering it in a permanent state. 

Therefore, to record someone with whom you are having a telephone conversation is to interfere with his privacy beyond what he has consented to. In a similar vein, it would amount to a breach of privacy to put your phone on loudspeaker for the listening of third parties when you have a telephone conversation with another person because to so would be causing an intrusion into the caller's private sphere beyond what she consented to. Before recording someone or allowing third parties to listen to what he says on the telephone, his consent must be sought or he must be informed such that he can decide to end the call if he does not want to be recorded or heard by third parties. 

Therefore secret recording amounted to a violation of the right to privacy which has been guaranteed by  Article 18(2) of the Constitution.

Furthermore, the Court had to decide whether the recording which has been obtained in violation of the constitutional rights of the Superintendent Minister ought to be excluded from the evidence being led in the case although its contents are relevant to the matters in contention.

The court held that in determining whether impugned evidence could bring the administration of justice into disrepute or make proceedings unfair, the court must consider all the circumstances of the case; paying attention to the nature of the right that has been violated and the manner and degree of the violation, either deliberate or innocuous; the gravity of the crime being tried and the manner the accused committed the offence as well as the severity of the sentence the offence attracts. The impact that exclusion of the evidence may have on the outcome of the case, particularly in civil cases where the establishment of the facts is of a high premium. These factors to be considered in determining whether to exclude or admit evidence obtained in breach of human rights are not exhaustive but are only to serve as guides to courts.

For instance, where the offence the evidence is offered to prove is a grievous crime committed in a gruesome manner and the infraction of the accused person's right by the police was unavoidable, in the absence of countervailing factors, the public interest would require that a court leans towards allowing the evidence since it would bring the administration of justice into disrepute in the thinking of the public to exclude such evidence. But where in a civil case, while the case is pending or at the time the dispute was raging, one of the parties with a view to procuring evidence in support of his case in court obtains evidence in violation of the human rights of his opponent, that is conduct that could also bring the administration of justice into disrepute.

Applying the above principles to the facts of the case at hand, it appears from the record that the plaintiff secretly recorded the Superintendent Minister with a view to using the evidence in court against him. To allow such deliberate violation of rights would encourage litigants to sidestep the rules of evidence and thereby undermine the integrity of court proceedings and bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The plaintiff certainly would have alternative means of adducing evidence in proof of his case and he should not be allowed to benefit from this intentional violation of the human rights of his opponent in the case. Our conclusion could have been otherwise if there were countervailing factors but on the facts of this case, the secret recording ought not to be allowed. In his statement of the case before us, the plaintiff offered no justification whatsoever for his interference with the privacy of the Superintendent Minister.

RE EFFIDUASE STOOL AFFAIRS (NO 2), REPUBLIC V ODURO NIMAPUA, PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL HOUSE OF CHIEFS; EX PARTE AMEYAW II (NO. 2) [1998-99] SCGLR 630 AT 670,

Acquah JSC (as he then was) on behalf of the Supreme Court said as follows: 
“For one of the basic principles of any civilized system of justice is that a person is entitled to a fair trial free from prejudice. No system of justice can be effective unless a fair trial to both sides is ensured… This common law right to a fair trial is now elevated to a fundamental right in the 1992 Constitution of Ghana.”

##  Article 19 (2) (e) and (g)

THE REPUBLIC VRS EUGENE BAFFOE-BONNIE AND OTHERS [2018] GHASC 40

On a proper and true interpretation of ##  Article 19 (2) (e) and (g), we hold that it is inherent in the right to a fair trial, of an accused person’s right to be given adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence as well as facilities to examine in person or by his [or her]lawyer.
The court held that  in order to meet the requirement of fair trial in criminal matters, it is the duty of the prosecution in both indictment and summary trials, to disclose to the defence, statements made to the police by persons who will or may not be called to testify as witnesses for the prosecution, as well as copies of exhibits and documents which are to be offered in evidence for the prosecution.The list of documents specified by the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) in her brief would therefore not meet this requirement. The prosecution must make disclosures available to the accused person in view of the fact that summary trial may commence within 48 hours upon arrest and charges being proffered against the accused. But the duty to disclose is not absolute; the prosecution has discretion to withhold material on grounds of relevance and privilege.  Failure to disclose a material before tendering it in evidence does not render the material inadmissible, but should result in an adjournment to enable the accused to study the evidence or material before it can be used by the prosecution.

##  Article 21(1) (d)

NEW PATRIOTIC PARTY v INSPECTOR-GENERAL OF POLICE [1993-94] 2 GLR 459

Per Charles Hayfron-Benjamin JSC,
In construing  Article 21(1) (d) and (4) of the Constitution, 1992, therefore, it is clear that (1) the concept of consent or permit as prerequisites for the enjoyment of the fundamental human right to assemble, process or demonstrate is outside their purview. Section 7 and 8 of NRCD 68 are consequently patently inconsistent with the letter and spirit of the provisions of  Article 21(d) of the Constitution, 1992 and are unconstitutional, void and unenforceable; (2) some restrictions as are provided for by  Article 21(4) of the Constitution, 1992 may be necessary from time to time and upon proper occasion. But the right to assemble, process or demonstrate cannot be denied. The sections of NRCD 68 which formed the basis of the plaintiff’s writ were ex facie

Per Amua-Sekyi JSC,
 I would have thought that it was self-evident that the continued enjoyment by any community of fundamental human rights was incompatible with any requirement that a permit or licence has power to refuse it. No one would regard a law which required that workers should seek the prior permission of their employers before organising themselves in trade unions as a reasonable restriction on their right to freedom of association. Any such restriction on the right to freedom of assembly would make it meaningless and a sham. Based as they are on a requirement that permission be sought of the executive or one of its agencies before the right to freedom of assembly is exercised, sections 7, 8, 12(a) and 13 of NRCD 68 are clearly inconsistent with   Article 21(1)(d) of the Constitution, 1992.


##  Article 21 (1) (e) 

MENSIMA AND OTHERS V ATTORNEY-GENERAL AND OTHERS [1997-98] 1 GLR 159

Articles 21(1)(e) and 24(3) of the Constitution, 1992 entitled every worker to form or join a trade union of his choice for the promotion and protection of his economic and social interest. However,  Article 24(4) of the Constitution, 1992 legitimised, inter alia, laws which were reasonably necessary to maintain the equilibrium between the competing interest and rights of the individual and that of the State. The compulsory requirement of membership could not be justified in terms of  Article 21(4)(c) of the Constitution, 1992, regulation 3(1) of LI 239 the  Manufacture and Sale of Spirits Regulations, 1962 (LI 239) was inconsistent with the letter and spirit of the Constitution, 1992, particularly  Article 21(1) (e) thereof

##  Article 23 

AWUNI v WAEC [2003-2004] 1 SCGLR 471 

Sophia Akuffo, JSC (as she then was) opined as follows:
“In my view, the scope of  Article 23 Is such that there is no distinction made between acts done in exercise of ordinary administrative functions and quasi-judicial administrative functions. Where a body or officer has an administrative function to perform, the activity must be conducted with, and reflect the qualities of fairness, reasonableness and legal compliance. I will not venture to give a comprehensive definition of what is fair and reasonable, since these qualities are dictated by the circumstances in which the administrative function is performed.
At the very least however, it includes probity, transparency, objectivity, opportunity to be heard, legal competence and absence of bias, caprice or ill-will. In particular, where, as in this case, the likely outcome of an administrative activity is of a penal nature, no matter how strong the suspicion of the commission of the offence, it is imperative that all affected persons be given reasonable notice of the allegations against them and reasonable opportunity to be heard, if the objective of  Article 23 is to be achieved”.

##  Article 33(1)

ADJEI-AMPOFO (NO. 1) V ACCRA METROPOLITAN ASSEMBLY AND ATTORNEY-GENERAL (NO 1) [2007-08] I SCGLR 611

Although the High Court's jurisdiction in   Article 140(2) appears to be very broad, the provision is nothing more than a practical restatement of the exception to the Supreme Court's jurisdiction, as defined by   Article 130(1), in cases brought under   Article 2(1),
The High Court enforcement power is, therefore, to be exercised within the scope of   Article 33(1), the language of which is clear. Hence the emphasis we must not lose sight of in   Article 33(1) is the phrase "in relation to him." In other words, in the High Court, the actual, ongoing or threatened contravention of the fundamental human rights or freedom must be in relation to the plaintiff and none else. However, where the human right or freedom sought to be enforced is not in relation to the plaintiff’s personal rights and freedoms, but for the purpose of enforcing a provision of the Constitution under   Article 2(1), the proper court is the Supreme Court. 
The Supreme Court’s jurisdiction in such a case is determined by whether or not the plaintiff is pursuing a personal interest.
