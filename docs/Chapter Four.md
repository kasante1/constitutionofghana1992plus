## Interpretation\Insight

 
##  Article 11(7) 
 
Stephen Nii Bortey Okane & 5 others v Electoral Commission of Ghana and Attorney-General 
 
WRIT NO. J1 / 2 / 2011
23RD JUNE, 2011
 
The target of the writ was the validity of The Local Government (Creation of New District Electoral Areas and Designation of Units) Instruments, 2010 (LI 1983). The Local Government(Creation of New District Electoral Areas and Designation of Units) Instruments, 2010 (LI 1983) was prepared and laid before Parliament. When LI 1983 was laid before Parliament, it had twenty-four electoral areas: twelve for Ledzekuku and twelve for Krowor.
 
When LI 1983 was laid before Parliament, Parliament referred it to its Committee on Subsidiary Legislation, per its Standing Orders.
 
The rule is that after 21 days, LI 1983 automatically came into force. In the instant case, by the time the LI came into force, the number of electoral areas in Ledzekuku had been increased to 16 while the electoral areas for Krowor remained as twelve.

By increasing the numbers, Parliament, through the Subsidiary Legislation Committee, had interfered with the LI as laid before Parliament. The main question raised in this case was how far Parliament could interfere with such legislation when it is laid before it for 21 days under the 1992 Constitution.
 
It is that source or the framers of the LI that has the power to amend the legislation. This is supported by the 1992 Constitution, article 297(d). 
 
In the instant case, what Parliament did by increasing the number on the electoral area of Ledzekuku from twelve to sixteen amounted to amending the Regulation laid before it.
 
There is no provision in article 11(7) quoted above for Parliament to amend the Regulation as laid before it. Parliament is authorized to annul the Regulations by the votes of two-thirds of the members of Parliament.
 
To the extent that Parliament amended the Local Government (Creation of New District Electoral Areas and Designation of Units Instrument, 2010 (LI 1983) differently from what was laid before Parliament instead of annulling it, the LI is ultra vires article 11(7) of the 1992 Constitution. It is therefore void and of no legal effect.

##  Article 297, Article 11(7) 
 
NII TETTEH OPREMREH VRS THE ELECTORAL COMMISSION AND THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL 
 
WRIT NO. J1/3/2011 7TH DECEMBER, 2011
 
The Plaintiff sought for a declaration that on the expiration of 21 parliamentary sitting days, the original copy of The Local Government (Creation of New District Electoral Areas and Designation of Units) Instruments, 2010 (LI 1983) which was laid before Parliament on 19th October 2010 automatically came into force under ##  Article 11(7) of the Constitution, 1992. 
 
The court held that it is clear that the original L.I, 1983 which was laid before Parliament on 19th October 2011 was not rejected or annulled by the votes of two-thirds of the members of Parliament.
 
By the interpretation given above, it is correct that the Local Government (Creation of New Districts Electoral Areas Designation of Units) Instrument 2010 L.I. 1983 which was laid before Parliament on 19th October 2010 automatically came into force by the operation of ##  Article 11 (7) of the Constitution 1992 after proof that there were 21 sitting days of Parliament after it was so laid before it. The combined effect of the above decision is that, the L.I. 1983 which contains the variations, amendments and or reviews made by the Subsidiary Legislation Committee of Parliament (See Stephen Nii Bortey Okane & 5 others v Electoral Commission of Ghana and Attorney-General) so far as it relates to the affected electoral areas are hereby declared null and void and accordingly struck down as unconstitutional.
