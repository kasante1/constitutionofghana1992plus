## Interpretation/Insight

    
##  Article 190,191, 195, 199

THEOPHILUS DONKOR V THE ATTORNEY GENERAL [2019] GHASC 52

Upon a true and proper interpretation, a Public Service Officer appointed in accordance with article 195 of the Constitution and may not be removed save in accordance with the terms and conditions of his or her contract of engagement or in the absence of such, for "just causeâ€Ÿ pursuant to articles 191 and 195 of the Constitution. Members of governing boards of statutory boards and corporations appointed in accordance with article 70(1)(d)(iii) of the Constitution are not members of the Public Service and their tenure is not governed by articles 191 and 195 of the Constitution. Therefore, each person may be removed at will by the President.

To the extent that section 14 of the Presidential (Transition) Act 2012, (Act 845) requires Chief Executives or Directors-General (howsoever described) of public boards or corporations to cease to hold office upon the assumption of office by a person elected as President of the Republic of Ghana, the same is hereby declared to be unconstitutional and void for being in contravention of articles 190 and 191 of the Constitution.

Article 70(1)(d)(iii) 

Presidential (Transition) Act 2012, (Act 845)
