<p>OCCUPY GHANA V ATTORNEY GENERAL (J1/19/2016) [2017] GHASC 24</p>
<p>Per Dotse, JSC</p>
<p>The “may” in article 187 (7) (b) of the Constitution 1992, becomes a mandatory may, and no longer permissive. This is to afford us the opportunity to enforce the provisions of article 187 (7) (b) which will deepen probity and accountability.</p>
<p>According to   Article 187 (7) (b) (i) of the Constitution, the Auditor-General is bound to issue a disallowance or surcharge where there has been any item of expenditure on behalf of the Government that is contrary to law.</p>
<p>According to   Article 187 (7) (b) (ii) of the Constitution, the Auditor-General is bound to issue a disallowance and surcharge where any person fails to bring any sum into the Government’s account.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Auditor-General under   Article 187 (7) (b) (iii) of the Constitution, the Auditor-General is bound to issue a disallowance and surcharge where the Government suffers or incurs a loss or deficiency through the negligence or misconduct of any person</p>
<h2 id="article-187">Article 187</h2>
<p>HON. P. C. APPIAH-OFORI v. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL [2/06/2010] WRIT NO. J1/4/2007 </p>
<p>The Supreme Court held that the Auditor-General is a public officer within the contemplation of Articles 70, 71, 146 and 286 and not within the contemplation of Articles 144 and 145 which deal with the Judiciary, in particular, Superior Court Judges.
According to   Article 70,  the mode of appointment, the oath of office, emoluments, independence, removal from office among others of the Auditor-General places him in the same category of the following officers, the Chairman of the Electoral Commission, Commission for Civic Education, Public Service Commission, etc. These officers have their age of retirement pegged with that of a Justice of a Court of Appeal but the Auditor-General does not share the same age of retirement.</p>
<p>The Constitution of Ghana, 1992 does not provide for the retirement age for the Auditor-General.  But   Article 199(1) of the Constitution, 1992 provides that:
“A public officer shall except as otherwise provided in this Constitution, retire from Public Service on attaining the age of sixty years.”</p>
<p>Furthermore, Section 10 (4) of the Audit Service Act (Act 584) amplifies   Article 199(1). Section 10 (4) states that “The Auditor-General shall retire after attaining the age of sixty years but may be engaged for a limited period of not more than two years at a time but not exceeding five years in all on any other terms and conditions that the President, acting in consultation with the Council of State, shall determine.”</p>
